They pair super easily with my iPhone and MacBook, and the stem has a lot more features than my old AirPods 2 (regular) had. They have the ability to go between ANC and pass through mode, and change the volume. It\\u2019s been great! I\\u2019ve also loved the wireless charging AND the built in speaker to help me find the headphones using find my. Great idea!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy only two grips with these headphones are that I had to exchange the original pair due to the right headphone not charging. Kinda annoying, but not the end of the world. I did buy a separate AppleCare+ plan though, in case this happens again in the future. Second, the eartips are not all that comfortable. Though, my ears are an unusual shape, and basically no in-ear headphones are comfortable. I also like that there are a swath of 3rd party available. Im going to try some foam tips and see if that helps comfort/fit. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I\\u2019ve been really happy with these headphones so far, and I recommend them to anyone with multiple Apple devices, as the device switching is the killer feature for AirPods.\",\n          \"Very cheap panel, makes the display tint very often to yellow with night light, images are also not very clear.

For example, over the last three days, I go to bed with all events being recorded and correctly sorted by imaging A.I.\\n\\nThen after awaking and having breakfast (with cars and people going past my windows for about an hour), I take my coffee to my home office, open the App to see what events had been recorded since last evening--and there are no events of any kind.\\n\\nAfter trying this and that, it seems that after I get around to resetting the camera and resetting my subscription, that new events resume being added. But there are still no events showing for a ~12 hour overnight and early daylight period.\\n\\nWorse is attempting to view events through my PC's online browsers (Google Chrome and MS Edge).\\n\\nAgain, the live view is fantastically good during both daylight and at night (despite the low outside lighting here), but trying to view events is a horror show.\\n\\nFor come reason, I have to fight with the settings to get the website to display the current day's events. Even when I try to clear everything, the original calendar setting returns eventually (which is the date I first installed the camera to yesterday's date).\\n\\nWhen I try to set the online viewing website to the current day's date , the current date on the website's calendar appears surrounded by a faded blue circle instead of the solid blue I believe should be the color of a selected date, and as one might expect, no events are shown for the current date even though I had a few hours earlier viewed cars in my browser being tagged by the App as the cars go by.\\n\\nI've tried both browsers, I've tried closing and opening the browsers, but as with the App itself, I eventually get it to work, I believe after resetting the camera and my paid subscription and restarting everything. But once it starts working, the missing overnight events remain missing.\\n\\nAnd then when it works, it seems to only present the viewer using the website with events for the past two hours even though I set the event time parameter for the last 12 hours. Worst, when going through the thumbnails, the user reaches the last of that two hour's worth of thumbnails, and the thumbnails just start over again, apparently in an endless loop. The first few times I went through this, I didn't realize at first that I was seeing the same events a second time.\\n\\nAlso, I could swear that after the App updates, it changes one or more of the settings I made.\\n\\nI've wasted hours fighting with this software and other nonsense.\\n\\nIt's a shame. Although I've only been using the camera for a short while, so I cannot attest to its durability, the hardware has nonetheless impressed, as has the accuracy of the artificial intelligence used to identify the various activities (possibly 97% accurate when it comes to images, though somewhat less when it comes to sounds). But that is then ruined by the Apps unreliability.\\n\\nAnd yes, I do have an SSD card installed (Wyze brand card), and I have the App set to continually record everything the lens sees. But searching by time is nowhere near as convenient as searching and more time consuming than searching for an event (what time was it when I heard that noise outside, I think it woke me up about 3am).\\n\\nSo far, the best value of the camera is live viewing. Should something really important have happened, hopefully in a worst-case scenario, claiming a ladder to remove the SSD card from the camera and then sticking it into my PC might be more convenient for finding a recording of a particular incident that the App failed to save as an event.\\n\\nUPDATE: my paid subscription continues to stop working once or twice a day. This most often occurs overnight. During such outages, my camera fails to record events of any kind. I have SSD cards in all cameras, which do seem to record everything, but scrolling through an SSD without events is tedious and worthless unless one is looking for a specific time.\\n\\nI have the App installed on a Samsung Android Tablet and on a Moto G phone. When my subscription fails to work, both my phone and Samsung tablet stop recording events (though while the the SSD card in the camera also fails to record those events, it nonetheless does record continuous 24/7 video).\\n\\nI have decided to buy another brand of cameras for outdoor surveillance.\\n\\nI will continue to keep and use the three wyze camera's I already installed because they are more work to remove than the refund is worth.\\n\\nAs soon as I find a better camera brand, I will end my paid subscription to wyze and use them for nature watching and keeping an eye on my basement while recording 24/7 to SSD cards.\\n\\nOne more thing: I am powering this camera using the Wyze outdoor light fixture adapter. It's possible the problem is being caused by the adapter because I have another Wyze camera, albeit of an earlier version, on my back deck that is powered by an electric outlet adapter, and this Wyze camera records events faithfully (In seven months, maybe once or twice I had to reset the camera or unplug and replug it into the electrical outlet).\\n\\nSo the difference could be in the kind of adapter I'm using or it might be that the earlier Wyze version was more reliable than the newest version (V4) that I am using with the lamp socket adapter.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          4,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Awhile back I decided to go with amazon, mostly because the non-internet version (hubitat) I settled with was too involved a process to set up, and required more attention. I'm gone alot, and have a truckload of things to do when I get home, so I literally don't have the time to mess with something like that. Enter Alexa's repertoire of things I can utilize. Since I'm already subscribed to pretty much everything amazon has, may as well just go all in, right?\\nAnyhow, item came in a day early (surprising, since I live in the middle of nowhere) along with my tp-link mesh system. Pretty much doing a tech overhaul at my house. Got rid of Starlink (great service, but support sucks in general) since spectrum entered into the area and signed up with them. Starlink uses just a single wireless router if you don't want to spend more $ for additional hardware. And then there's other issues I just didn't want to subject myself. I digress.... Set up the mesh system, got spectrum running, and started connecting things.\\nFirst thing was the doorbell. This to me is still a novel thing. Yes I know its been around for awhile now, but remember, i'm doing a tech overhaul here. Didn't bother with such things before, nor cared too much about em. So, after some thinking, I installed it at the traditional place (front door), and used the wedge to angle it a bit to catch the front sidewalk. Connected it to the mesh system (took a minute, as I was unfamiliar with the system). It pretty much installs itself. It's all run off the phone as far as configuring and whatnot. You WILL be required to install the blink app. It's not part of the amazon app. Not sure why, ask Jeff about that one. Sync module is a no brainer, just follow the directions.\\nHere's the interesting part. I don't need yet another subscription, so I opted out of the cloud storage thing. With the app, you can pull clips off the sync module using your phone, and do whatever you want with them anyhow, don't need a sub to get it. Save yourself a few dollars and go the route I went. Get a usb stick. HOWEVER, I didn't get a usb stick just for the sync module. I have a microsd storage card (350 gig) from my previous phone that I couldn't use in my new one (fold 5), so it just sat around being randomly used as a transfer tool between pc's. So why not use it as storage for the module? Well, I plugged it into a sd card multireader and stuck it into the module... AND IT WORKS. Amazon states max is 250, but I've got an extra 100 gigs with my microsd card :)\\nWill tech support help if it breaks down? Doubt it. The research I did says that although higher capacity cards may or may not work in the module, support is limited to cards with a max of 250 gigs. Not sure how that works out, but I don't write software so whatever.\\nLong story short, camera works great. Fiddle with the sensitivity though. I set it too high (lvl 7) and got alerts from the clouds going by. Dropped it to 6, but its too dark to tell if that helped. In the end, i'm happy with my purchase. Quality is great, and does what it says it's supposed to do. Good luck!\\n\",\n          \"This review is for someone on the fence about a handheld gaming system... if you intend to use this mostly docked... move on to another review.\\n\\nThe screen is small for me. I grew up with the original GameBoy, GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advanced, and finally the GameBoy Advanced SP. That should give you some idea of my age. Even wearing glasses, the 7\\\" screen is too small for most text. I like RPG's and story based games, and the text is often not optimized for the smaller Switch screen.\\n\\nFinding cases is about impossible. Maybe there are more now, but in 2022 I had to improvise because there were almost no cases that the OLED would fit in. I purchased a padded sling bag and added extra foam to prevent damage if dropped.\\n\\nThe battery dies VERY fast. You pretty much have to be next to an outlet if you're gaming longer than 2hrs... maybe if you sat in the dark and turned the screen brightness down.\\n\\nThe screen scratches about as easily as an old school CD or DVD. I had to wait for my screen protector to be delivered and played the Switch for a few days, kept it in a padded case when not in use, AND it got a small scratch on the screen.\\n\\nIt struggles with ports. Games made by Nintendo work great on the switch. Ports of games made for beefier hardware struggle on the Switch.\\n\\nFYI, I sold my Switch and purchased a gaming laptop.\",\n          \"I\\u2019ve had the LG 65-inch UT70 Series for a while now, and overall, it\\u2019s a solid TV for the price. The picture quality is sharp, with vibrant colors and good contrast, making movies and shows look great. Setting it up was easy, and the design is sleek with thin bezels, which gives it a modern look. The built-in webOS has all the major streaming apps, but the system can be a little slow at times, especially when navigating menus or switching between apps. The sound is decent for a TV, but I\\u2019d recommend a soundbar if you want a fuller audio experience. One downside is the remote\\u2014it\\u2019s small and not the easiest to use, especially in the dark. Also, while the TV handles regular HD and 4K content well, it doesn\\u2019t get very bright for HDR, so it\\u2019s not the best for super detailed highlights in darker scenes. But for the price, it\\u2019s a great value, especially if you just want a big screen with good quality for everyday watching.

            "\n",
            "In need of replacing my long-serving and excellent Apple wired keyboard, I wanted a new keyboard as close to the original as possible, in terms of layout, look, functionality and reliability. Unfortunately, after much time-consuming exploration, the only candidate I could find that came even close to matching my criteria was this Apple so-called \"Magic\" Keyboard. I finally pulled the trigger on purchasing it after asking Rufus, Amazon's supposedly genius new AI assistant, if the Magic Keyboard could be used as a wired keyboard with Bluetooth turned off, and Rufus answered that it indeed could.\n",
            "\n",
            "Well, sadly, after receiving the keyboard and trying it out, I quickly discovered that Rufus was dead wrong in his answer to my question (though in fairness, Rufus has correctly and even intuitively answered other questions that I've posed about other items).\n",
            "\n",
            "So, with that strike against the keyboard, plus the fact that its pointlessly light gray letters on the keys are annoying at best and likely prone to fading in the future at worst, and also the fact that the Magic Keyboard, unlike the old Apple wired keyboard, lays flat with no riser underneath the front to lift and curve it slightly — in view of all of these negatives, I decided to return this piece of ... (ahem) \"Magic.”\n",
            "\n",
            "And that's where Amazon REALLY fails big-time on this item. For, as a few other reviewers have noted, the only way one can return this Apple product is IN-PERSON to a Whole Foods or an Amazon store. No UPS, no USPS, no other way. Yes, despite the fact that you can order it online and Amazon delivers it to you, you have to return it IN-PERSON!\n",
            "\n",
            "I complained to Amazon Customer Service about this — and even offered to pay for the UPS return myself — and they still insisted that it had to be returned IN-PERSON!! Had I known this in advance, I NEVER would have purchase the keyboard from Amazon. But — and here's where Amazon's return policy on this item is not just a nuisance, but also highly deceptive — there is absolutely no mention in Amazon's stated return policy pertaining to this keyboard that the item can only be returned IN-PERSON to a Whole Foods or Amazon store. That being the case, I've filed a complaint against Amazon with the New York State Division of Consumer Protection. If Amazon is going to maintain such a return policy, the restrictive terms about “in-person returns only” should be spelled out in writing. Currently, they are not.\n",

            "Explanation: There are many negative words in this comment like \"dead wrong\", \"fail\", \"pointlessly\", \"annoying\". The \"REALLY\" is in caps to strengthen the negative feeling. Overall the review is strongly negative, and thus is a 1-star review.\n",

But I was very happy with the feeling, use, and connectivity to my MacBook. Yes. I bought another.\n",

The picture from the Amazon delivery driver showed that it had been delivered but to the wrong unit. They said they would send another out in a couple of days. I got no email confirming this. Waited 2 days did not get replacement phone. Was lucky though because someone had dropped it off to my complex managers office and they gave me the phone. The first phone was supposed to be unlocked. Put SIM card into phone would not work. The phone was Verizon not for TMOBILE. Called to get a refund and return. Amazon sent another phone 4 days later. That phone did not work either. Would not text or turn on and off properly. So now I have to pay $40.00 toward an Uber bill to get it over to UPS or Amazon Fresh to get both returned so I can get my original $140.00 back.\n",

The sound quality is phenomenal, with enhanced drivers delivering deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The active noise cancellation effectively blocks out background noise, and the new ear tip sizes ensure a perfect, comfortable fit. The improved battery life and quick charging feature are convenient, and pairing with my iPhone is seamless. The intuitive touch controls and the new Find My feature add to their appeal. Overall, these AirPods offer exceptional sound, comfort, and advanced features.\n",

        "Title: Bad Keyboard, Even Worse Customer Service\n",
        "Content: The one star is as much for Amazon's presentation and returns policy with respect to this keyboard as it is about the keyboard itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "In need of replacing my long-serving and excellent Apple wired keyboard, I wanted a new keyboard as close to the original as possible, in terms of layout, look, functionality and reliability. Unfortunately, after much time-consuming exploration, the only candidate I could find that came even close to matching my criteria was this Apple so-called \"Magic\" Keyboard. I finally pulled the trigger on purchasing it after asking Rufus, Amazon's supposedly genius new AI assistant, if the Magic Keyboard could be used as a wired keyboard with Bluetooth turned off, and Rufus answered that it indeed could.\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, sadly, after receiving the keyboard and trying it out, I quickly discovered that Rufus was dead wrong in his answer to my question (though in fairness, Rufus has correctly and even intuitively answered other questions that I've posed about other items).\n",
        "\n",
        "So, with that strike against the keyboard, plus the fact that its pointlessly light gray letters on the keys are annoying at best and likely prone to fading in the future at worst, and also the fact that the Magic Keyboard, unlike the old Apple wired keyboard, lays flat with no riser underneath the front to lift and curve it slightly — in view of all of these negatives, I decided to return this piece of ... (ahem) \"Magic.”\n",
        "\n",
        "And that's where Amazon REALLY fails big-time on this item. For, as a few other reviewers have noted, the only way one can return this Apple product is IN-PERSON to a Whole Foods or an Amazon store. No UPS, no USPS, no other way. Yes, despite the fact that you can order it online and Amazon delivers it to you, you have to return it IN-PERSON!\n",
        "\n",
        "I complained to Amazon Customer Service about this — and even offered to pay for the UPS return myself — and they still insisted that it had to be returned IN-PERSON!! Had I known this in advance, I NEVER would have purchase the keyboard from Amazon. But — and here's where Amazon's return policy on this item is not just a nuisance, but also highly deceptive — there is absolutely no mention in Amazon's stated return policy pertaining to this keyboard that the item can only be returned IN-PERSON to a Whole Foods or Amazon store. That being the case, I've filed a complaint against Amazon with the New York State Division of Consumer Protection. If Amazon is going to maintain such a return policy, the restrictive terms about “in-person returns only” should be spelled out in writing. Currently, they are not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explanation: There are many negative words in this comment like \"dead wrong\", \"fail\", \"pointlessly\", \"annoying\". The \"REALLY\" is in caps to strengthen the negative feeling. Overall the review is strongly negative, and thus is a 1-star review.\n",

But I was very happy with the feeling, use, and connectivity to my MacBook. Yes. I bought another.\n",
        "This next keyboard has only lasted 4 months and the L shift key is again sticking. I have been very conciencious about whether I lean on that key etc, and I don't! I haven't spilt or eaten on it. again popped off and cleaned, didn't see anything but it worked another couple weeks and started in again.\n",
