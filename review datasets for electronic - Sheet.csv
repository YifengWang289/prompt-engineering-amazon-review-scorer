100% better sleep,"I’ve been supporting Oura since it was a kickstarter. I had the version 3 and decided not to upgrade but since my spouse lost her ver 3 I gave her mine and ordered this.

If you’ve never had an Oura ring: this product is amazing. So comfortable, more so than a watch. The app is great, I’ve learned so much about sleep habits, what to do and not to do for sleep. Lovers of science will like this, you can literally experiment and see the exact results for yourself.

Accuracy: I would say this is 95% accurate. Again, I’ve been using this for about 5 years. So I’ve seen the accuracy improve IMMENSELY over the years. Version 4 is the best yet. Better than any other sleep tracker I’ve tried and I’ve tried a lot. The biggest inaccuracy is every now and then I’ll get up to pee in the middle of the night and it will think I woke up for the day. Sometimes it knows I just went to pee sometimes not. Since I noticed it, I take my ring off if I get up to go to the toilet and it fixes the issue—just don’t forget to put it back on!

Key info for consumers: the fit is slightly larger than the version 3. To be exact I would say the version 4 is about half a size larger. So the new size 7 for example, would be a size 7.5 on the old version 3 and older models.

The new size is great for me. My old ring was snug on my ring finger. So now I can wear the new one on my pointer finger and even middle finger depending on how hot it is. It all depends on the temperature outside due to our hands expanding/shrinking in heat/cold. Hot days I’ll wear on my ring finger, cold days I can wear on my index or middle finger.

Conclusion: I love the Oura ring. It’s more comfortable than an Apple Watch or a woop in my experience. Way, WAY more comfortable. It’s also very accurate and the info is extremely useful. It’s increased my understanding of sleep, the importance of exercise for sleep, and dare I say, made me a better person. Getting better sleep takes effort, and this is merely a tool to help you do that. Getting better sleep can 100% make you a better person and I speak from my own experience.",5
One month in! It's great!,"I've been wearing the oura ring gen 4, stealth, size 9 for exactly one month now.

First off, sizing.
I was between sizes 9 and 10. I opted for the smaller size using this little test: Using the plastic ring sizes, if you cannot take off the ring in the morning when your fingers are puffiest, and the only way to do so is by wetting your finger to add some slippage, then that's the right size. With the bigger size, I was able to take off the ring in the morning without using water so I felt that size was too big. One month later, I am glad I went with the smaller size. No discomfort and still using water in the morning to take off the ring before I shower.

Comfort
I wear it on my right index finger. I did not like in between fingers, which is the reason I wear a silicone wedding band. But overall, it's not very intrusive. It's annoying to write with a pen or pencil but that's not often.

Appearance
I love the stealth color. Already got a few scratches on my palm side, which is a little annoying. But I tell myself that at least the back of my hand, the ring looks like new. I use these silicone protectors when working out with weight and it does a great job. The scratches came from handling things where I should have taken off my ring. I wish there were some way to make the scratches less visible as these scratches you see a shiny silver metal which contrasts a lot!

Battery
No issues. I charge it every few days or so while I shower. I am manually trying to keep the battery at between 25% and 75% but most often I forget that I left it charging and it goes back to 100%.

Sleep Tracking
I'm not a power user. I enjoy checking in the morning my sleep score and compare it to how I thought my sleep went the night prior. Pretty accurate sleep tracking in my opinion.

Fitness Tracking.
So we all know that the step counter is way off so I don't really care about that. However, the ring really is good at spotting fitness ""events"" and I love that when opening the app, there's a backlog of events that you have to confirm the type of activity. My top three are: housework, walking, and HIIT. The app gets better at recognizing the events so most times I am just confirming instead of categorizing. Overall, this level of tracking is simply encouraging me to be more active, which has lead to a good impact on my health.

Overall, pretty satisfied with the ring. Glad I got it.",5
"Quite useful, despite some quirks","I bought the Oura 4 primarily to analyze my sleep, but I have ended up wearing it all day. I have an apple watch ultra that is fine for daytime activities. I thought the Oura would be better for analyzing sleep because it has the SpO2 sensors for oxygenation, and the battery lasts much longer after a charge than the apple watch. The information it gives me about the quality of my sleep is better than I expected, and I now have a better understanding of what my issues may be at night. It shows you when your oxygen levels varied during the night, which is useful, but one of its quirks is that it doesn't show you the actual timeline of blood oxygen values. I would really like to see the actual values and not just the periods of variability in a timeline. It does give the average value during sleep, and it seems to think my sleep is ok, which reassures me that I probably don't have sleep apnea. Also, I wore both my apple watch and the Oura for two nights, and they gave significantly different values for the total time awake during the night. From my own memories of waking up, the Oura seemed to be more accurate. Also, I came across a research study (paid by Oura) that compared it to the apple watch, and it claimed that the Oura was more accurate for judging time awake. My biggest surprise was today, when the Oura app told me that I was essentially under the weather and I should rest today. In fact, I haven't felt very well since yesterday. It was amazing to me that the Oura determined that. It said my nighttime temperature was elevated and my breathing rate higher than usual. But, in another quirk, it did not actually give me the numbers to back up these conclusions. Did Oura think I could not handle the truth? :) Oura likes to give general conclusions, like your activity levels are fine, your sleep was fine, etc, but it seems like it tries to avoid giving you all the raw data in some cases. I found that very annoying at first, but I am getting used to it. It does give you a time line of activity and HR. I have only had the Oura for a week, and the app has mentioned that it is establishing my baseline for the first couple of weeks. I assume that once the baseline is established, it will be able to tell me whenever I fall outside my usual range on different measures. That should be very useful. I didn't expect to like the Oura ring as much as I do, because I thought it might not provide much more information than my apple watch. But it actually does, at least during sleep. When I think I may be coming down with a bug, it is reassuring to know when the Oura thinks so too. It is also nice that I don't have to recharge it for several days. The Oura cannot replace an apple watch, of course, because it does not display messages and does not have access to apps that I use. The best of all worlds is to have both.",5
First time Full-size Foldable owner!,"I originally got a Zflip 5 and liked the compactness and versatility, hence I decided to give the fold a try!

Pros:
- the beautiful, large screen is perfect for multi-tasking, for example: texting somebody about a vacation destination and taking quick screenshots and sending it right to them on the other side of your screen
- The external cameras are an amazing improvement from last year, likely because Samsung tuned their auto-ai-whatever image processing.
- the foldable screen makes it it's own stand! YouTube even has a built in mode that turns the bottom half into the video controls!
- The springs don't drag it open or close like my flip, so I can stand it at almost any angle!
- materials make it feel premium! Samsung put a lot of effort into perfecting the foldable feeeling of quality. I also own an S24 ultra and they feel almost identical in terms of trust I have in the physical design and materials. Extremely well machined!
- using the outside screen doesn't feel terrible and cramped as I had expected. It's a lot like when I got my flip and thought it was weirdly tall, but I got used to it.
- ecosystem integration is finally to a point I can recommend people get everything Samsung, like the watch, ring, and tablets! Copy and paste works, if I need to open a message on my phone from my watch, I can immediately just open my phone, copy an OTP, etc.

Ehhh:
- Battery life is middling, it will last you all day, BUT with low-medium use. I am in a job where I use it around 4 hours a day and it struggles to be at even 20% at the end of my day.
- Samsung bloatware is Mostly removable, I miss my pixel phones with completely uninstallable to no bloatware. I hate that we have non-uninstallabke bloatware like AR camera or Bixby (Google assistant FTW)

Cons:
- app support is getting closer to being more widespread but still not where it needs to be, some apps have issues with both the external and internal display ratios, whether it be too skinny to display things, or too wide to display things properly.
- front/internal camera is terrible, it is taking a picture through the screen, but it is simply unacceptably bad
- Brightness of the screen is not enough for outdoor use. I went to a local restaurant today and noticed I could barely see the screen with extra brightness enabled in overcast weather.

Overall 8.5/10

TL:DR
Physical design is impeccable, however software support and battery life hold it back from being what Samsung envisions: the perfect compact phone. 8.5/10",5
" For those ALREADY used to Samsung's ""Note/Galaxy"" series of Phones, this is the next logical upgrade","After years of our family using a variety of Android phones (I have 2 front pockets so I also carried an iPhone), we settled down on the Samsung Note series for a few generations. I attempted to upgrade my wife to another brand folding ""Phablet"" (by all accounts it is best-of-breed) but she was too used to the Samsung Android implementation and found the changes a painful struggle to attempt to adapt to. So I took the non-Samsung folder and upgraded her to the Z Fold 6. She is now ""a happy camper"", which, of course, makes me a happy camper. The Z Fold 6 works reliably and largely consistent with past Samsung phones, but it isn't cheap nor necessarily best in class (why do you think I first started with a different folding screen phone? Because there are technically better ones out there).

- There are Pros and Cons of other folding screen phones, but it all depends on what you are used to and if your technical background prepares you for major changes you'll face when switching platforms. For a lot of people, once they've made the time commitment to go thru the learning curve to become functional the often aren't amenable to making a new time investment to switch, so they stay with the platform they are use to.
- I've lived in Tech from mainframe days and across most every conceivable new Tech since, so for me exploring/learning new Tech is ""business as usual"" - an extension of many of my past jobs (I've worked for a number of manufactures in new product design and first use roll-out and to discuss details with others meant they needed to execute a NDA). But for most others (MOST - not all), I expect they want what takes the least effort. When people ask me ""what should I get?"" unless they have demonstrable technical ability I'll usual recommend ""what do your friend have - unless you want to be alone on an Island, you'd best stay with the flock so you have others to ask when you need help"".",5
 Great Camera but not much different from the original,"The Canon R5 is one of the best cameras I have ever used in my production business. It’s versatile for both photo and video and has some impressive autofocus, dynamic range, and creative frame rates such as 120fps. You have the option for 8K with internal recording to the robust CF express type b port. Additionally, You can use your SD port for lighter media.
In the industry I’ve seen this camera body used in photo and video capacity for weddings, real estate, business marketing, social media content, podcasts, portrait photography, interviews, sports, journalism and even wildlife.
The R5ii offers all the same features as the original but not much else other than enhanced autofocus, slightly better photography frame rates which for a hybrid camera are impressive, C-Log 2 for professional video, (the R5 only offers C-Log and C-Log 3) and on forums people say it has better clarity and contrast than the R5. I haven’t really noticed much a difference though. Think of the upgrades compared to the next and new version of an iPhone. It’s new and shiny but not much different from the phone you just traded in.
On the body, you’ll have an improved viewfinder, and a designated switch for photo and video mode. The original R5 had a more complicated interface for switching between stills and video.
All and all, if you are looking to upgrade your camera bodies and you are looking to stay on a budget I’d highly recommend the original R5 as it will be much cheaper now. But the R5ii is a solid choice for professionals and hobbyists alike.",5
Best Camera System For Your Home! None As User-Friendly As BLINK!,"Works EXTREMELY well, as I expected! I've been a user of Blink Cameras for several years now, so it only made sense to eventually adapt and hook up a doorbell camera.
Easily synced with my current Blink outdoor system/hub with no issues. The ""view size"" obtained by the doorbell camera is extremely wide, covering my entire porch, walkway, and the street in front of the house. VERY high quality picture and easily works with the Blink App to be monitored and customize the settings of your entire camera system. The Blink App has incredible features, such as the ability to block out grid squares that you don't need to be alerted on, so it won't false alert for things such as passing vehicles on the road. By blocking out the entire street beyond your sidewalk/yard, the system will not alert you until someone crosses the invisible grid line you've created around your home. BEST FEATURE AVAILABLE!

The built-in microphone is VERY HIGH quality, and can be adjusted easily through the app as well. The doorbell sound quality is top notch and the phone connection when ringing is a nice standard tone that isn't alerting or annoying.

If I had one request to adjust the design & features, I would LOVE to have an additional doorbell hub (OTHER THAN AN INDOOR CAMERA!) on the inside to hear the doorbell throughout the house! I, personally, don't care to monitor the interior of my home or the people inside of it, so indoor cameras are not something I am willing to take on to extend the doorbell alert to anywhere but my smartphone.

Overall, it's a top notch security camera (and doorbell), and if you're familiar with the Blink operating system or currently use a Blink camera at your home, then the Blink Doorbell is an easy addition to the security of your home.",5
"Well, it works like it said it would","In the process of automating my home, and finally got around to adding a video doorbell. Awhile back I decided to go with amazon, mostly because the non-internet version (hubitat) I settled with was too involved a process to set up, and required more attention. I'm gone alot, and have a truckload of things to do when I get home, so I literally don't have the time to mess with something like that. Enter Alexa's repertoire of things I can utilize. Since I'm already subscribed to pretty much everything amazon has, may as well just go all in, right?
Anyhow, item came in a day early (surprising, since I live in the middle of nowhere) along with my tp-link mesh system. Pretty much doing a tech overhaul at my house. Got rid of Starlink (great service, but support sucks in general) since spectrum entered into the area and signed up with them. Starlink uses just a single wireless router if you don't want to spend more $ for additional hardware. And then there's other issues I just didn't want to subject myself. I digress.... Set up the mesh system, got spectrum running, and started connecting things.
First thing was the doorbell. This to me is still a novel thing. Yes I know its been around for awhile now, but remember, i'm doing a tech overhaul here. Didn't bother with such things before, nor cared too much about em. So, after some thinking, I installed it at the traditional place (front door), and used the wedge to angle it a bit to catch the front sidewalk. Connected it to the mesh system (took a minute, as I was unfamiliar with the system). It pretty much installs itself. It's all run off the phone as far as configuring and whatnot. You WILL be required to install the blink app. It's not part of the amazon app. Not sure why, ask Jeff about that one. Sync module is a no brainer, just follow the directions.
Here's the interesting part. I don't need yet another subscription, so I opted out of the cloud storage thing. With the app, you can pull clips off the sync module using your phone, and do whatever you want with them anyhow, don't need a sub to get it. Save yourself a few dollars and go the route I went. Get a usb stick. HOWEVER, I didn't get a usb stick just for the sync module. I have a microsd storage card (350 gig) from my previous phone that I couldn't use in my new one (fold 5), so it just sat around being randomly used as a transfer tool between pc's. So why not use it as storage for the module? Well, I plugged it into a sd card multireader and stuck it into the module... AND IT WORKS. Amazon states max is 250, but I've got an extra 100 gigs with my microsd card :)
Will tech support help if it breaks down? Doubt it. The research I did says that although higher capacity cards may or may not work in the module, support is limited to cards with a max of 250 gigs. Not sure how that works out, but I don't write software so whatever.
Long story short, camera works great. Fiddle with the sensitivity though. I set it too high (lvl 7) and got alerts from the clouds going by. Dropped it to 6, but its too dark to tell if that helped. In the end, i'm happy with my purchase. Quality is great, and does what it says it's supposed to do. Good luck!

This checked all my boxes for home monitoring system,"I was initially looking at another brand because they had a wireless video doorbell that came with its own chime. My home was built in 1897 and I don't have existing doorbell wiring or chime in the house. So wireless doorbell that came with a chime was the way I wanted to go. Only problem, this other brand didn't offer all the options and/or configurations I was hoping for.

Then I was introduced to Blink. It had all the options I needed. Granted it doesn't have its own chime, BUT....you can use the mini or Alexa as your indoor chime. Perfect! Had the corner mount so I could point the video doorbell camera towards the entrance to the porch. Again, old home on a corner with a wrap around porch where the entrance to the porch was on the corner and the door was at the end of one side. Does me no good to have the camera pointing straight ahead into the front yard. You can mix and match all of the devices to get the optimum setup for your needs, and they all connect seamlessly.

Then I started doing my research on Blink. Reading the reviews from customers really made me question if I should buy. Too difficult to install. Too difficult to set up. Can't connect to Alexa. Battery life a fraction of what they claim. Cameras always disconnecting. I'm glad I ignored the reviews, chalking up the technology issues to people just not being tech savvy. I was right.

Installation was extremely simple. Not a fan of the online instructions instead of a booklet, but I managed.

Sync Module, video doorbell, 3 outdoor cameras and 1 mini indoor camera connected to the Blink system with no issues.

Connecting to Alexa was equally as flawless. Set up the Blink skill in Alexa and ""she"" immediately found all the Blink devices. Our Echo in the living room, Echo Dot in the bedroom and the indoor mini will all serve as chimes wherever we are in the house. The Echo devices will also announce any motion detection. We can arm and disarm the system by voice command with Alexa. Disarm does require a voice pin code which you have to set up in the Alexa app.

Setting up and managing the devices in the blink app is fairly intuitive and straight forward. You can adjust the motion sensitivity, set up privacy and no detection zones. After setting up the doorbell out of the box, we would get random motion detection notifications. After checking the clips, it had to be either vehicles passing in the street facing the door, or a flag flapping in the wind at the end of the porch where the steps are. I shut off motion detection in the street, lowered the sensitivity slightly, but left the flag area on, and no more false detection's. So it was definitely not the flag tripping it. Camera still picks up people as they come to the top of the steps and alerts us.

Video quality is pretty decent. I'm please so far. Haven't been able to test what the night video looks like, or the two way voice at the doorbell yet. Once I am able to and if there are any real issues, I will edit my review.

As far as battery life, it's too early to tell. All the documentation I have read indicates that with the sync module and turning off settings or features you don't really need will extend the battery life to the 2 years claimed. Time will tell.

If I had a complaint so far, it's the fact that the time it takes from notification until a live view of the camera finally comes up in the app, the person tripping the motion detection has dropped off the package and left. That timing needs reduced greatly.",5
 Perfect!,"The Ring Spotlight Cam is a fantastic addition to any home security setup. With its easy installation and high-quality video and audio capabilities, this camera provides peace of mind and protection for your property.

Setting up the Ring Spotlight Cam was a breeze. The instructions were clear and straightforward, and the app made connecting the camera to my Wi-Fi network a simple process. Within minutes, I had the camera up and running, ready to monitor my property.

The video quality of the Ring Spotlight Cam is impressive. The 1080p resolution provides crisp, clear footage, allowing me to easily see any activity around my home. The camera also has night vision capabilities, so I can keep an eye on things even in the dark.

Not only does the Ring Spotlight Cam provide excellent video quality, but it also has two-way audio, allowing me to communicate with anyone near the camera. This feature has come in handy when I've had delivery people at my door or when I've needed to scare off potential intruders.

The motion detection feature of the Ring Spotlight Cam is another great aspect of this camera. I receive instant notifications on my phone whenever motion is detected, allowing me to quickly check the live feed and see what's going on. This has helped me feel more secure knowing that I am always aware of any activity around my home.

Overall, I highly recommend the Ring Spotlight Cam to anyone looking to improve their home security. With its easy installation, high-quality video and audio capabilities, and motion detection feature, this camera provides reliable protection for your property. I give it five stars and will continue to rely on it to keep my home safe.",5
Amazing Comfort and Unique Sound Experience with Sony LinkBuds,"I am thoroughly impressed with the Sony LinkBuds! These truly wireless earbuds are a game changer for anyone who wants to enjoy music or podcasts while staying connected to the world around them. The open-ring design is a brilliant concept, allowing ambient sounds to naturally filter through while delivering rich, clear audio. This makes them perfect for outdoor activities or walking around the city, where you need to stay aware of your surroundings but still want high-quality sound.

The newly developed air-fitting supporters are incredibly comfortable and ensure the earbuds stay securely in place without feeling bulky or uncomfortable, even after hours of use. They’re super lightweight, which makes wearing them feel effortless. I was surprised by how good the sound quality is for such a small, open design—everything from vocals to bass comes through cleanly, and they’re surprisingly loud without being overwhelming.

Another standout feature is how easy they are to set up and connect, with a stable Bluetooth connection that never drops. The battery life is impressive, lasting for hours of continuous use, and they charge quickly. Whether I’m at the gym, out for a walk, or just lounging at home, these LinkBuds are my go-to choice.

If you're looking for a pair of wireless earbuds that offer great sound, comfort, and a unique open-ring design for an immersive yet safe listening experience, the Sony LinkBuds are absolutely worth it!",5
Comfortable earbuds with great sound in both directions,"Sometimes, you want a set of earbuds that block out the sound around you (say, on a plane for instance) but often you might want to hear what's going on around you even if you're on the phone or listening to music. And that's where these earbuds come in - with an open ring design, you can NATURALLY hear both what's coming from the earbuds AND what's going on around you so you don't have to take them out to have a quick conversation (maybe if, for example, placing your morning coffee order) and they don't have that fake ""amplified"" quality that the transparency modes in some normal earbuds have. So the design works well for it's purpose, still offering clear audio with great range (though not much bass which is typical for earbuds this small) for both music and spoken word / phone conversations. The microphones seem to pick up sound well even in a loud environment as the folks I've used them to talk to have confirmed I was clearly audible. And you can really also hear what's going on around you which is GREAT when that's what you want.

As far as other features, I did go ahead and install the Sony app to get finer grained control over the sound / a graphic equalizer, but the app isn't necessary for basic functionality and the earbuds will work fine without it. I LOVE that the case is so compact as well, many earbud cases seem to be unnecessarily bulky but that's not the ""case"" here (HA) and that makes the case easily pocketable so I can carry them everywhere (which is sort of the idea anyhow). The battery has good life and they fit my ears / stay in well (which is a surprise as with most earbuds I have to go through several options of ear ""bits"" to get a good fit, but these stay in place without the need for interchangeable tips). They do seem to have the typical Sony quality of build so they should last for some time to come.

So if you're in the market for good, high-end earbuds with clear sound on both the speaker and microphone portion AND you're looking to stay aware of your surroundings / hear ambient noise around you even while wearing them without the tinny amplified transparency mode, these earbuds could be just the right option for you. Give them a try today!",5
good headphones,"Beats is the brand I dreamed of getting headphones from, and finally I bought them. But everything is not as great as I thought. 1st point - sound. In my opinion, the upper frequency range is greatly exaggerated, that with music that has a lot of high frequencies, the headphones begin to sound terrible. The midrange and bass are normal. 2nd point - comfort. The first few days they squeezed my head, and the ear pads pressed on the edge of the ear, but then everything went away, and now the headphones sit normally on my head. 3rd point - color display on the phone. This may be just my problem, but for some reason the headphones on my iPhone are displayed in black, and not white, what color are my headphones now. 4th point - microphone. No one can hear me normally in these headphones, everyone complains that they can't hear me well. But let's move on to the positive points. Noise reduction and transparency mode. They suppress noise so well that sometimes you can't even hear anything, and in transparency mode everything is perfectly audible, as if you were without headphones. Convenience. I take these headphones with me every day wherever I go, and they are very convenient for every day, since I am not comfortable with in-ear headphones, I like overhead headphones. They are quite compact and fit in the pocket of my jacket. You can also easily wear them on your neck, they do not cause discomfort. The connection holds perfectly, but sometimes the connection is lost. Restarting the headphones helps. With my use, the charge lasts about a week (I always use transparency mode and noise reduction, I do not turn it off) The design is not bad, but if it was white with gold like in Studio 3, then I would gladly buy this color, but this one is also not bad. The charging speed is not very fast, but having charged 5-10 percent, the headphones can work for a long time",5
Paragraph Guy Here!,"The Studio Pros are fantastic headphones! To all the people who left low stars because they didn’t like the sound quality aren’t utilizing their headphones properly. Apple put a lot of tech into these headphones and honestly outperforms the AirPods Max in almost every regard. When you first get the headphones you essentially want to listen to stuff right away out of the box and this is why some customers returned their headphones. You need to set up your headphones in settings for Spatial Audio and you need to set the proper EQ for you to get the full immersive experience! The noise cancelation is exactly the same if not better than the AirPods Max (note to others, I have the WC silicone Sweat Resistant Protection cups on my headphones creating a full seal against my ears vs leather allowing for sound leakage and outside sound to enter). That’s also another thing to mention, get the WC covers, not only does it make the sound better, it protects the leather, feels even more premium, and prolongs the lifespan of your headphones overall. Back to the Studio Pros, the best EQ I have personally found to work for me is the Classical and Rock EQ apple has built in settings. This EQ brought out the louder and deeper bass that people originally were expecting from Beats but instead most people didn’t even bother to try to utilize the tech. Transparency mode is phenomenal, the chip inside has a built in filter that actively changes what is desired noise live. I tested this by using a leaf blower in my yard and after 2 seconds the headphones knew that it was undesired sound and lowered the sound instantly. I then had my neighbor speak to me with the leaf blower still going on and I was able to hear their voice clearly since the microphones on the outside of the Studio Pros are constantly listening and filtering for essential sounds. When it comes to Spatial Audio, I noticed that I personally liked fixed the best as it sounded like true surround sound. When you have the Spatial Audio set to head track you have to imagine that the audio is always in front of you like in a theater. If you turn ur head left or right in a theater, whatever ear is pointed towards the screen will pick up more audio, this is the same exact feeling you get from the head tracking mode for Spatial Audio. I personally like fixed Spatial Audio as it sounds like surround sound in both ears and are perfectly balance regardless of head movement. Also when you plug in the headphones via usb c to your pc, gaming audio is like wearing 2 subs on your head it’s absolutely phenomenal! You can hear every detail the game intended you to hear and more, I noticed I started hearing enemies more often and was able to react faster because of these headphones (felt like I was hacking). Do not plug these headphones into your pc with the aux cable, it will not have the lossless audio function nor will the aux be able to power on the headphones so it technically will be running passively like regular headphones without any features. When comparing the Beats by Dre Pro headphones plugged into aux into my pc vs the Studio Pros, the Beats by Dre Pro outperformed the Studio Pros. But as soon as I plugged the usb C into the pc and directly into my Studio Pros, it was absolutely no contest, the Studio Pros completely blew the Beats By Dre Pro out of the water. Finally to conclude this review, my friend recently bought the Beats Pill Kim K Light Grey Edition for me for my birthday because it looked like the colors would match. They in fact do match very well. It’s funny how the Studio Pros are labeled as Sandstone but for the Beats Pill it is listed as a Kim K Light Grey Edition. Also if any of you are curious about the quality of the Beats Pill, get it while it’s still $99! You won’t be disa",5
Excellent Low cost AirPods Max alternative! A classic revisited!,"My earliest forays into a More expensive headphone was with the Beats Brand and the wired Beats Pro headphones. Then I graduated to the wireless Beats Studios, as well as the Executive headphones and those were my headphones for years. I don’t recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn’t take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don’t really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn’t bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I’ve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth’s settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use “Hey, Siri’ but I’ve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the “B” button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can’t really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn’t a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I’m a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don’t like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!",5

The Beat Goes On,"Beats headphones are a solid choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, stylish design, and reliable performance. Here’s a breakdown of their strengths:

1. Sound Quality

Beats headphones are known for their bass-heavy sound signature, which makes them perfect for genres like hip-hop, pop, and electronic music. While the bass is prominent, recent models (like the Beats Studio Pro) offer a more balanced sound that appeals to a wider range of listeners.

2. Comfort and Design

Beats excel in design with a sleek, modern aesthetic and a range of colors to match any style. The over-ear models feature plush ear cups that provide comfort for long listening sessions, and the on-ear models are lightweight and portable.

4. Apple Ecosystem Integration

Beats headphones, especially wireless models, pair seamlessly with Apple devices, thanks to the H1 or W1 chip. Features like quick pairing, device switching, and audio sharing enhance usability for Apple users.

5. Battery Life

Battery life is another highlight, with many models offering up to 40 hours of playtime on a single charge. Fast Fuel charging is also a plus, providing hours of listening after just a short charge.

6. Durability and Portability

The build quality is sturdy, and they fold easily for storage, making them great for on-the-go use. The carrying case adds an extra layer of protection.

Final Thoughts

Beats headphones offer a combination of style, performance, and features that make them a top choice for casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may not be the most budget-friendly, the premium quality justifies the price. If you’re looking for headphones that sound as good as they look, Beats are worth the investment.",5
"If you can get it at a discount, it's a no brainer.","Been using these for a few weeks now. I'm very happy with them and I still feel good about pulling them out of their case and putting them on before a workout, flight, or while watching something online. Some of the reviews said there is not enough bass. I have no idea what those people are looking for, or maybe they are stuck in the 80's listening to 2 Live Crew and Miami Bass Wars, but they have more than enough bass for what headphones should put out. If you need more bass than this then get in your Honda Civic with your 2 18"" kickers and rattle your brains out, but these are headphones, they sound great. They do not need more bass.

The functionality of these are great, the controls are pretty intuitive once you watch a video on all the controls and options. I really like the option of directly plugging into a phone or laptop when you want.
One reason I got these because some outside sources vote these as the best gym over the ear headphones. I've used these working out, and they will work for certain things and certain people, but if you're doing High Intensity stuff, even lots of cardio, then you do run into issues. The sweat on the pads gets gnarly, then they start sliding down or feeling uncomfortable. They move a lot more than in the ear type when you're running or moving around quickly. I typically sweat a lot when I workout, so I've been using my AirPods Pros more, but if I'm just going to do like lifting, in an air conditioned gym and take 2-5 minutes between sets, then these would work. I prefer the sound and ANC on the Beats, but for working out, I still prefer wearing the AirPods just because they secure. I was not able to comfortably jog a long time with these, it's too humid and hot here and they start slipping and dripping a few minutes in.

The Beast Studio Pro are really good on airplanes and trains. The noise cancellation is the best I've experienced. Overall, really good, so glad I got them on sale, they replaced some old Bose ones, and these are certainly an upgrade. If you're going to pay full price, maybe think twice, but if you get it slightly discounted, get it. I'd just caution against these if your soul purpose for getting them is to wear them to workout and you sweat when you work out... you'll be disappointed.",5
"The King is back, for a niche audience","I loved my Beats Solo headphones as a teenager. I’m talking monster cable beats. Nothing was cooler, the bass was thundering, and while it didn’t sound great, it sounded so much better than the iPod in ears or my dad’s old crappy walkman on-ears I was used to. I listen to mostly electronic music, bass/dubstep, house & techno, all of that with some hip/hop and pop sprinkled in as well. I also love movies.

As an adult at home, I have my beyerdynamic dt 770 pros for mixing and editing with. I have a pair of AirPods Pro 2s for travel and day to day usage. Recently, I have started to work from home a lot more in meetings, and there has been a lot of construction outside my window, and I hate having things stuck in my ears for hours on end so I was in the market for a pair of noise canceling over ear headphones.

My partner has a pair of AirPods Max, I found the sound to be really great, detailed with good sound stage and flat great for voice but clinical and safe in all respects and lacking the bass I was looking for. Even with the top-of-the-pack anc and apple integration features I was used to on my in-ears I never could swallow the price. Also they were comfortable, but so heavy and not suited for long periods of wear. And the case was weird.

So I tried the bereydynamic lagoon ANCs. They were garbage. Impossible to use the controls and pair with devices, sounded really good but not as good as I would expect from this brand, and the issues go on and on. They did have good bass, but the anc barely worked. I liked them at a lot at first, but they fell apart so quickly.

Then I saw that apple had brand new beats headphones, and were 30% off on Amazon. I had to try them, the nostalgia hit hard and I’m so happy they didn’t change the iconic design from the studio 2s which I also liked as a replacement for my solos. I. Am. Floored. Super lightweight yet feel very solid and no creaking, apple integration features (i consider no auto switching to be a plus tbh, but icloud pairing is a must. Works very well with Apple TV), but the sound! Is so FUN. It’s like I’m in a concert hall with huge racks of speakers and towers of subwoofers. So much better than my old beats, by a landslide. Great instrument separation, and decent soundstage, sounds less like a wall of sound like my pro 2s do but not as wide and spatial as the max. A little bright for my taste, but never enough to cause fatigue. None of them come close to the 770s of course - would I recommend these for classical? Or acoustic? Never. Or for any type actual professional work? No. But if you like electronic, you will have so much fun enjoying music with these. The ANC and transparency is very very good, identical to my AirPods Pro, I would argue maybe even better than the max in some situations. The mic quality is good, not as good as my AirPods but good enough for work calls. I also love watching movies, and having multi-channel support like my pro 2s is epic. I absolutely love these - and am so happy I got them!",5
I am a Hearing Impaired Customer- I CAN NOW HEAR SONGS LIKE THEY WERE MEANT TO BE HEARD -,"The Beats Studio Pro Wireless Bluetooth Noise-Cancelling Headphones are a triumphant blend of style, cutting-edge tech, and phenomenal sound quality. Whether you’re a music aficionado, a remote worker, or just someone who wants premium audio on the go, these headphones deliver a stellar experience.

What Stands Out:
Personalized Spatial Audio:
This is a game-changer. The headphones adapt sound to your unique preferences, creating an immersive, 3D-like listening experience. Whether it’s your favorite playlist or a blockbuster movie, the depth and precision of the soundstage are simply mesmerizing.

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):
The ANC is outstanding, effectively drowning out background noise whether you're on a plane, in a bustling café, or working from a noisy home. If you need situational awareness, the Transparency Mode works like a charm, letting ambient sounds filter through without removing the headphones.

Premium Comfort:
With plush ear cushions and a lightweight frame, the Studio Pro is designed for long listening sessions. I wore them for hours during a work marathon, and they remained snug and comfortable without causing ear fatigue.

Battery Life for Days:
You get up to 40 hours of playback without ANC (or 24 hours with it on). Quick-charge technology adds 4 hours of listening in just 10 minutes—a lifesaver for those ""oops, I forgot to charge"" moments.

Sleek and Stylish:
In true Beats fashion, these headphones are a style statement. They look as good as they sound, with a premium build that feels durable and high-end.

Seamless Bluetooth Connectivity:
Pairing with both iOS and Android devices is a breeze. The multipoint connection is a bonus, letting you switch between devices (e.g., your phone and laptop) effortlessly.

Room for Improvement:
Price Point:
While the features justify the premium price, it’s definitely an investment. Audiophiles and frequent users will appreciate the value, but casual listeners might hesitate. I would recommend watching for a price drop or holiday sale.

Bass-Heavy Sound Profile:
True to the Beats brand, the bass is punchy and prominent. While it’s great for pop, hip-hop, and electronic music, those who prefer a more neutral sound for classical or podcasts might find it a bit overwhelming.               Who Are These For?
These headphones are ideal for anyone who craves a high-quality, immersive audio experience with advanced personalization features. They’re perfect for commuters, travelers, and remote workers who need stellar noise cancellation and comfort, or music lovers who want their sound tailored to perfection.

Final Verdict:
The Beats Studio Pro brings the best of Beats’ iconic sound and style into a more refined, personalized package. While the price and bass-heavy tuning may not suit everyone, the spatial audio, noise cancellation, and comfort make these headphones a top-tier choice for premium wireless listening.

If you want headphones that are as functional as they are fashionable, these are worth the splurge.",5
Don't fall for the deep discount,"Sound is good, but build quality isn't great. All plastic, and tyey don't feel very robust. Originally listed for $130 and they would be a total rip off at that price. I paid $20 and that feels like what they are worth. Over inflating the list price seems like a really underhanded sales tactic.",3
Does NOT work with other Alexa devices.,"This tv has an Alexa button that ypu can control the TV with. But you can NOT run TV with Echo or Alexa app from phone. Not a single action! Also, the voice remote, unlike with Roku, does not have a find your remote feature. The TV shuts off very quickly if paused and you have ZERO options to change this. So just going to the bathroom shuts off your TV, never mind if you have kids or pets that need attention. The sound quality is okay of basic TV but horrible for music. Picture is decent but honestly this TV is the worst TV I have ever owned. I miss our Roku tv so much! This tv leaves me wanting more and honestly, my Roku tv worked great with Alexa, how is it my Amazon Fire tv doesn't work at all? FandangoHome( Vudu) app is horrible as well. Only things I like are my cameras connected to my Amazon account can be watched on the TV with picture in picture while watching something else. And, Amazon music can play in the background with app closed. Other than that this tv is a major disappointment.",3
There’s a problem.,"There’s a problem. I bought this to use just as a regular TV. When it is first turned on it starts showing ads for various Amazon shows, the volume is really loud. Then it switches to the input for which it was set, but only some of the time. On other occasions it performs just as it ought; turning on to the broadcast channel that was last on.
Twice now I have turned it off only for it to turn on again some minutes later.
Picture is clear but when watching a broadcast channel the sound volume is much lower than when it starts up playing the ads. All in all it’s a bit of a nuisance.",3
Expensive Toy…Not sure it’s working properly.,"Based upon the hype and price, I expected better quality. Using the EKG/ECG is useless and about 90% of them come back “Poor Recording”. Have tried it multiple times, and took into account that it is new to me, I had my Granddaughter, who happens to be BS/RN and who has one and recommended it to me, tried 3-4 times and got the same result. She said that it may be just my unit that is faulty. She never got a good reading in all her try’s. I have gotten a couple of good readings, but less than 10% of the tries. The “step” counter also is not accurate, as I walk my dog a couple of times a day and I would check the counter, yesterday it read 1800 steps and we walked almost a half and it recorded 150 steps. I like that if my phone is in the case, I can “see” or feel a call or text come in while outside. I purchased the metal band for it and really do like that, the stock band was too large for me and in south Florida the band caused my wrist to sweat.
Also on the ECG app, when I get a poor reading there is no easy or quick way to repeat the reading attempt that I’ve found, you have to wait and let it reset. Disappointed that the text alert on the watch does not allow you to open the text to read the full text without taking your phone out.
To me this is an expensive toy.",3
Damaged Package,"Watch: 5/5
Package: 2/5

Firstly: I am new to Apple watch and I already love how this works and I wonder how it can be effective for my daily usage. It’s sleek and looks good on my wrist. I got an 46mm with a M/L band. Which is almost comfortable.

Secondly: the packaging of this Apple Watch which you can find in the above picture says it all. It been mildly damaged and I wonder the seller (Amazon Dark store) has a proper and neat storage of electronics. You don’t expect that the damaged packed would be received by you. I wonder if it’s handled properly in the first place and I’m not quite sure if the watch is damaged will they replace it or not. When I read about the reviews they don’t if the package is open.",3
Difficult plugging in,"I really like the idea of having multiple connectors on a single cord because it reduces the number of cables that I must carry when traveling. I also love the flexibility of the cable jacket. It’s easy to coil the cable up for storage, and it doesn’t have any bends or kinks when I lay it flat. It’s nice not only having an USB-A to USB-C adapter plug that fits into the connector that plugs into the wall charger, but having that adapter plug held onto the cable so it’s not lost.

The only thing I don’t like is how hard it is to plug the connectors into their devices. When I plug into a wall charger, the USB-A male connector feels like something is scraping against the metal housing or the electrical contacts. Even when I use the USB-A to USB-C adapter, the USB-C male connector is a tight fit into multiple wall chargers. On the other end of the cable, the Apple lightning connector is a tight fit into both my Apple Magic Mouse and my wife’s iPhone 13. The USB-C connector is an extremely tight fit (and again feels like something is scraping) into my Google Pixel 4 phone. This makes me hesitant to use this cable on a regular basis, but it should be okay for traveling since it won’t be plugged in and out too often.

Anecdotally, my wife says that her iPhone 13 charges slower with this cable compared to the Apple lightning cable. When I’ve used it to charge my Google phone, I don’t notice a big difference in charge times.",3
Do not buy if you are interested in photography,"Product is very good but the lack of a viewfinder makes this small device very difficult to use in a normal sunny day... I was initially attracted by the small size but I decided that the viewfinder is absolutely crucial for what I do .. I upgraded to an A6700 and even if the viewfinder is not that great there is no comparison, costs more but it's a very well balanced product. So the ZVE10 II could be interesting only for pure video but it is necessary to find some protection for the display during sunny days otherwise it is basically very frustrating to use..",3
 Poor Speakers - You Need an App,"Be aware that the MacBook Pro speakers are very poor for the spoken word. They are over-enhanced, which creates reverberation that makes the audio mushy and unclear. If you listen to podcasts, audiobooks and films with dialogue, you may not like this laptop.

MAR 31, 2025: I am bumping this MacBook Pro up to 3 stars. After downloading the ***SpeakerAmp*** app from the Apple Store, the sound of the spoken voice is more clear. With the free version of the app, you just turn on its equalizer (there are no adjustments) and the app seems to know what people need. (SpeakerAmp also boosts volume, if you want that.)

I haven't use this MacBook Pro much yet, but this is what I have noticed:

PROS: The entire area of the touch pad is responsive to navigation and clicking links--nice!

CONS: Apple has a short return window of 2 weeks. The latest OS provides no way to adjust the built-in output speakers (other than volume)--there is no equalizer control; you will need an audio app. Remember: the MacBook Pro has no touch screen.",3
"My first Mac, coming from Windows.","Pros:
Very thin, light and sleek.
The hardware is very impressive, I mean the psychical build of the laptop and its aluminum build.
The screen and keyboard are also very top notch.
The m4 chip is very fast, zero lag
The massive 24 gigs of memory is abundant and allows the laptop to tear through tasks.
Apples own mac os is fast and snippy and their built in apps are all great!
It has great compatibility with my iphone 13 and can even let me use a virtual version of my phone when using the macbook air.

Cons:
Lack of ports, 2 usb c ports is inadequate.

But the biggest issue is this..
You simply cannot run as many applications as a windows pc can, alot of my games, engineering, and finance apps are simply not compatible with macos, it could be due to the arm chips in the system or the smaller install base on apple pcs but the fact remains you can't even run games like overwatch or diablo4 on mac natively...

It feels like a glorified ipad.

As a massive pc gamer this is a big draw back for me, this makes the mac feel more like a toy and not a serious computing environment.",3
"Slow to respond, mediocre image quality","I bought this TV because it was the size needed to fit within a constrained space, but provide the maximum screen size for the subject space - and it was cheap.

It fits well and the screen size is fully maximized for the allotted space - to which I am happy.

What I don't like about this TV is that it is very slow! Compared to my prior TV which was just a standard TV (vs. a smart TV), everything worked faster than on this TV. On this TV, when I select a channel or stream, it takes nearly twice as long vs. my prior TV for that channel/stream to open and commence. Of course, this is always a problem with streaming vs. live TV - but this TV is slow to a whole new level of being slow.

Image quality, especially for live broadcast sports is also wonky. When I put on a football game, there are numerous instances that initially image quality is super low - like worse than non-digital over the air antennae TV quality. It certainly isn't anything resembling HD. But alas, this awful quality only lasts several seconds before it finally fixes itself.

But then, the game camera chances to a different camera - and if the scene is very different than the prior camera angle, this can repeat itself - dropping to such a low quality level that it makes watching useless (you certainly can't see the football, or even the player number, or even read the yardage markers painted on the field). But alas, this corrects itself after a few seconds. But this happen way too often.

I don't know if the TV should have been designed with a higher buffering capacity so that, while being a few seconds behind the live game, the image quality would be consistent. I don't know if the video digital conversion processors used are such a low quality that they don't have the power to provide a consistent reliable image, or what?

The other thing that I fear is that I've now bought a pretty cheap smart TV to replace what was a pretty cheap standard (ie. not smart) TV. Everything about this TV tells me that if it lasts 5 years, I would be very lucky. The prior unintelligent TV lasted over 15 years . . .

So in general, I would say that I can't recommend this TV overall. It works, but not particularly well. It seems like it's cheaply made (with the chips, electronic components, etc. . . ) For the first few weeks, I considered returning it (actually still have the box) thinking it must be defective . . . The pluses are that it's a perfect fit for my limited space and it was cheap (ie. didn't cost very much).",3
"How did they release a ""top of the line"" TV with exclusively outdated ports?","TV is thin and great video quality, but there is 2 glaring issues with it and a cherry on top that ill start with.

1. The hdmi cord it comes with is actual trash, do not use this cord, go buy yourself a proper hdmi 2.1.

2. The screw holes for the mount are not on the same plane, nor are the holes accurately measured, so be extra careful when installing wall mounts and cut your machine screws a good 4mm short of the 30mm they suggest. (The built-in threaded nuts are also not very well installed, 2 of mine seemed to be semi free-spinning and I had to slightly pull on the machine screw as I turned it to lock the nut into place so it would tighten).

3. This TV comes with 0, I repeat 0, displayport ports (how did this even get pushed out without one?). Displayport 2.1 blows hdmi 2.1 out of the water in bandwidth and max refresh rate; most mid-high end modern pcs come with MOSTLY displayport ports for this reason. This tv would absolutely benifit from displayport ports on just raw output alone. Additionally, if youre like me and have a modern pc and an older 2nd or 3rd monitor taking up your only hdmi port, this TV will take that port and you're out of luck.

They basically only accounted for console gamers and gen x+ I think, which is odd because I've known people for ages that have been running their TV services primarily off of their pc, maybe smart tvs have changed consumer habits? But pcs are far more versatile so leaving the option properly en would have been nice. Rant over.

S+ Screen Quality
A- speakers: for being on-board, they aren't bad
B+ Build quality: mostly relative to competitors. If not for the state of the tv market this would be a C at best.
Most tvs are built cheap with nice tech inside, this paperthin monitor with 0 screen reinforcement is a scammy gemmic to minimize material cost and make it easy for people to break their own screens, it offers 0 value because the base of the tv to around halfway up the back is still a couple of inches thick, so it saves you 0 space and removes maybe 2 to 4 lbs in total tv weight.

F- ports: give me usb and hdmi but no displayport on a state of the art tv? Get out of here with that, nope. Z- If it were an option.",3
"Good Headphones for Most, but Not for Me","It's been a while since I last owned a pair of Beats and I thought these would be better, when in reality, it was just more of the same. The only real good thing I can say about these is that they do, in fact, have great battery life and their design is sleek, but other than that, they just weren't for me.

These Beats Solo 4's do come with a carrying case along with the charging cable and an AUX cable for wired playback, which I appreciate. The headphones fold up compactly and they are easy to transport, but I do have one issue with the folding mechanism that I'll talk about later. The headphones are lightweight and small, and the design is great. The headphones are easy to adjust for your head size, and the ear pads have modest cushioning. The Bluetooth pairing is simple, and on my iPhone I was immediately prompted when they were powered on to connect them.

Now, let me talk about the sound quality. Unlike the older Beats which were mostly bass focused, in my opinion, these headphones were much more neutral with a flatter EQ that I generally prefer. It makes game audio richer when listening for enemies, it makes background instruments in songs more vibrant and focused, and it just allows you to hear things more how they truly sound. Except, something went wrong with the treble or the midtones or something as they were extremely sharp sounding. Most music sounds great and it is harder to notice this sharpness unless the volume is loud, but for listening to podcasts or watching online videos- that sharpness is extremely noticeable, especially in people with softer speaking voices as they sound almost whispy with sharp ""s"" and ""t"" sounds. These sharper voices almost make it sound like people or hissing as they talk and I just couldn't get over it. Admittingly, this issue is much less noticeable when using them wirelessly with my phone where I have more direct control of the EQ, but when using them wired on my PC or through my PlayStation controller, that ability to adjust the EQ diminishes. For movies or well produced content, some of that issue is more mild, but as a huge online content consumer, who mainly uses them wired, it was just not my taste. I know some won't have this issue, and I just might be more sensitive to it, but that was my experience.

Furthermore, we have to talk about my other complaints. First off, the hinge mechanism for holding the headphones is a bit dangerous if you have your hands near it when storing them, as I got my finger badly pinched a couple of times while doing just this. That may not be an issue for some, but I feel like I won't be the only person to experience that. Additionally, the comfort could be a bit better. Despite the headphones being lightweight, the clamping force on the ear cups is still very strong and after just an hour of wearing them I would begin to get migraines from the pressure. My head is fairly normal sized, and even when adjusting the headband to be looser, that experience didn't stop. The headband itself is also not that comfortable. The headband, which has a silicone-like padding, gets very thin and flattens out a lot as your body heat from your head warms it up. After a while, you will feel that the headband starts to sink a bit more into your scalp before it becomes uncomfortable. Once again, all of this is just my experience, but worth mentioning.

The main thing I can say is that the battery life is actually really good. They seem to charge quickly, and I haven't had issues with leaving the charger connected which destroyed one of my older Beats Studios from years ago. The battery seems to last forever as you scroll through videos, watch movies and play mobile games before that recharge is necessary.

Overall, I ultimately returned these headphones. Not because they were bad, but just because they weren't a good fit for me. The sharpness in some voices over the wired connection was hard to ignore, and the migraine inducing pain from the poor comfort also wasn't worth the subpar experience I was having. While these headphones may still be great for a lot of people, I had to share my thoughts to be as honest as possible.",3
3.0 out of 5 stars No banana for scale please accept Dr. Pepper instead,"I've always used cheapo off-brand headphones, so when I seen these on sale during Christmas for $99 I decided to treat myself. The presentation was exceptional, and I was star struck when I took them out the box. Unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros.
What I liked: How they look
- the soft cushiness of the ear pads
- the sound is phenomenal
What I did not like:
- after wearing these for about an hour my ears hurt really bad.
- the rubber like material on the underside of the headband would pull my hair
- the space in between the headband and the ear muffs would get my hair Tangled in it and pull it out. I don't have alot of hair either it's thin and flat, but after it happened a couple of times I had to start putting a bonnet on (if at home) or a hat (out walking) when I wore them.
The icing on the cake was I ordered some others to see if I like them better before sending these back, and the ones I just got for less than $20 sound just as good as these and they are a lot more comfortable!! They are not as cute or cool looking by any means, but I care more about comfort and value than looks. I'm so thankful for the extended holiday return window or I would have been stuck with these and wasted my $100. I can't even imagine someone paying what the price is right now.",3
Faulty HDMI cord,"Initially when my ps5 arrived today, I was super excited. Out of the box it was clean and sleek and very nice to look at. All the cords including the controller were seemingly undamaged. I plugged everything up to my Insignia Fire TV and the PS5(Fortnite edition) would not show up on my TV. I tried different HDMI ports and still nothing. I read the booklet it came with and then I had to watch videos and research what was wrong with it. The one thing I hadn’t done was try a different HDMI cord. Luckily I had my PS4 HDMI cord. After hooking my PS4 HDMI cord to my PS5, it came up on my TV. I tried the cord with my PS4 and it wouldn’t cast any image to the tv with my PS4. My new $424 PS5 HDMI cord is faulty. I still like my PS5 don’t get me wrong but now I am frustrated and irritated that I had to spend all that money for something not to work. I waited a long time in saving up for the money for this only to be disappointed.

Update: my 18 day old controller now has stick drift…",3
Fun for the right person,"This review is for someone on the fence about a handheld gaming system... if you intend to use this mostly docked... move on to another review.

The screen is small for me. I grew up with the original GameBoy, GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advanced, and finally the GameBoy Advanced SP. That should give you some idea of my age. Even wearing glasses, the 7"" screen is too small for most text. I like RPG's and story based games, and the text is often not optimized for the smaller Switch screen.

Finding cases is about impossible. Maybe there are more now, but in 2022 I had to improvise because there were almost no cases that the OLED would fit in. I purchased a padded sling bag and added extra foam to prevent damage if dropped.

The battery dies VERY fast. You pretty much have to be next to an outlet if you're gaming longer than 2hrs... maybe if you sat in the dark and turned the screen brightness down.

The screen scratches about as easily as an old school CD or DVD. I had to wait for my screen protector to be delivered and played the Switch for a few days, kept it in a padded case when not in use, AND it got a small scratch on the screen.

It struggles with ports. Games made by Nintendo work great on the switch. Ports of games made for beefier hardware struggle on the Switch.

FYI, I sold my Switch and purchased a gaming laptop.",3
Good Standalone VR Headset. Unusable PC VR Headset,"for a TL:DR, I would say if you are looking for a PURE standalone VR headset and do not plan on ever using your PC on wired mode, then I'd say you'd find value in purchasing this product, but if you want to use the Quest as a standalone AND wired/wireless PC VR and using it for serious tasks or gaming, stay away, buy a dedicated PC-VR headset or give up on using this headset as a PC-VR headset.

I have had the Quest 3 since early May, and coming from the Quest 2 it is a good upgrade, I have not used the passthrough features that the Quest 3 offers that the quest 2 does not even have, but as more of a gamer I have had little need to use those features. The best way I can describe the Quest 3 to the Quest 2 is more akin to going from the Xbox One to the Series X, PS4 to PS5, unlike going from something like the Wii U to the Switch, where the upgrade is purely a Hardware with some software upgrades rather than a complete overhaul, which I do say is nice, considering you can just take your Quest 2 library and just jump into the games again after you download them on your Quest 3.

The Quest games itself have gotten a slight upgrade, taking better advantage of the hardware, and providing a more clear and crisp image, with some performance upgrades in some games. I find that games that show long distances look a lot more crisp and clear, making for an overall much better immersion in games, the design itself looks more appealing with the 3 beans in front and the slimmer design, the controllers bundled in are just the Quest Pro controllers missing the cameras for self tracking, I already have Pro controllers so I cannot say for how good the Quest 3 controllers are, but they felt nice enough when I opened it. However, changing the lenses' positions felt confusing and never felt like they remain secure, though this is in my experience, as I also wear glasses.

However, if you plan on buying this, also buy a different strap, the one bundled in is truly atrocious, Don't buy the elite strap from Meta, too overpriced and they made the one bundled in bad on purpose so you buy their overpriced 'Elite' strap, look into 3rd party ones, they are much cheaper than the 1st party offerings.

Overall I'd give the Quest 3 an 8/10 when it comes to it being played and used as a wire free VR headset

What really drags this down is in the Quest Link, which is so bad I would rate it a -10/10.

Why?

Because it never works after a few tries...

For context , my PC is more than capable of playing most if not all VR games at mid-high settings with a constant 30-60 fps, minus some instances where a lot of resources were being pulled by any game. though those were rare.

And to be clear, this is not the fault of any hardware from the Quest 3 nor my PC, this is from just how unfathomably atrocious the Quest Link software is, and this is not new, you look these problems up, I can go back as 2021, so not only does Meta know about this, they have been actively refusing to fix this issue, their only response is ""Update your quest software"", other solutions seem to work, but require you doing a Fresh Install of Windows, or doing other steps with the Link software, and before you ask, I have deleted my Link software and downloaded a new app of it, I have done the PTC, none of these options have worked, and I am NOT going to be doing a fresh install of Windows because Meta can't patch something like this, and if this was a Hardware issue, It would have surfaced from day 1, but this happened very much after I started using the Quest for my PC.

And for those saying I am being lazy: I am the Customer, I bought the product, End. Of. Story. It is not, nor should it ever be, my responsibility, as a consumer, to have to become Linus Tech Tips, Gamers Nexus, and Nicola Tesla's child and fix an issue Meta is VERY much aware of, and has had at the bare minimum, 3 years to fix said issue, yet has not. The very fact that you have to look to others to fix a persistent issue that has followed the Quest since the Quest 2 days is an issue in it of itself, if this was a new development, I would absolutely not hold it against the devs that are maintaining the Quest Link software, but it isn't, I have already looked up everywhere on Meta Forums, and they have all said the same thing.

Will the Quest Link work? For the first few times, but then once it stops, good luck, or you might be lucky and not have any problems with it. Some might ask if I am using a Quest Link Cable? Yes I am, and using the right ports, am I using the Meta one? No... I am not paying 80 Dollars for an overpriced USB-C Cable, seriously, The Quest Link Cable is so overpriced that it should be a crime to purchase it, besides, there are posts where people are experiencing the same problem with much better hardware than me, and even using the Quest Link Cable itself, I am using a USB 3.0 Cable to a USB-C Cable, a 3.0 Cable is compatible with the Quest Link software.

and the Quest Link using Wireless never works either, do not even bother using it, you will not be able to connect to your PC, even if it see's it, and the lag itself is not worth it, I am playing in the same room with the PC, there is nothing interfering with the connection like a wall would, and I am still experiencing lag and immersion breaking issues, and my PC is connected with an Ethernet port, so my internet is no issue either.

Overall, the Quest 3 is a nice standalone product, even a good upgrade from the Quest 2 IF you really want those nicer graphics, but if you are buying it purely to use it or using it heavily for the PC, save your money and purchase something else, it might be cheaper to buy this or the quest 2 compared to something like the Steam VR, but you will be in a world of hurt dealing with these issues, and if you have a quest 2 and are happy enough with it, I would say stick with the Quest 2, coming from it myself, it is more of a step up rather than a true upgrade, think of it like a Nintendo 3DS to a New Nintendo 3DS.",3
A REAL Review,"Ok lets start with the CONS 1st because we got more of them than Pro's

not comfortable. if you got a med to large head you will defiantly be upgrading the facial interface on this. you may also experience headaches. same with the head strap. its just cheap and difficult to adjust. you will need to buy a different one. interface adjustment are on the inside on the included interface, so you will need to put the HMD on and off as needed to adjust the viewing distance. if you use glasses, you will not be able to use this HMD with the included interface as they will not fit. IF you try to use glasses you may get headaches. If you use a 3rd party cable for PCVR on this you may experience errors. to eliminate said problems you will need to buy the OFFICIAL Meta cable. if you buy lens inserts for a prescription I recommend getting the magnet type, if you have strong scrips you may experience trouble installing them. This IS a FALSELY advertised product. they claim that this is a premium HMD, NOT EVEN CLOSE. says 4K res 2064x2208 per eye is NOT 4K. 3840x2160 IS 4K PER EYE. resolution scaling is adjustable but may cause problems and instability. the IPD adjuster is really tight and the range is NOT what they claim it to be. battery life is 2hrs and can be extended with a premium strap with battery attached or by other means. meaning YOU need to spend more money. and loads of users have reported BRICKING do to lack of proper update testing on Meta's side. ALSO not recommended for PCVR. USB3.0 is only 5gig's and wile a lot of games will work just fine, some and future games WILL NOT run correctly at this bandwidth. on wireless you may not have any issues, BUT you will need a Hi end wifi6 router that's capable of at least 10gig's and NOPE the routers under $500 will NOT cut it. most the brands/models under $500 only do 2.5gig's on the lan port and you need 10. YES usb3.0 has a bandwidth limit. if they would have used 3.2 like the competitors did this wouldn't be a problem. backwards compatibility has nothing to do with the bandwidth. this HMD is also a bit heavier than say if you were coming from a Rift-s do to its battery. people claim its lighter. no it is NOT. hand tracking is the pits and is NOT accurate. and it seam Meta and HTC are copying one another. this HMD $499 + $40+ for a better interface $80+for lenses and $20+ for a different strap $80 for the PCVR cable you are at about $700+ for this HMD. if you want wireless +$500 so that's $1200+
HTC Vive is around $1200 depending and defiantly a PREMIUM HMD the ONLY con I have found so far with the vive pro 2 is the stacked fesnal lenses. so Meta found a way to make you PAY just as much.

PRO's

Nice screens. defiantly a SMALL upgrade from past HMD's
good lenses. YEP pancake lenses are great
slightly larger FOV and that's determined by the distance of your face to the lenes
can work with PCVR
hand and arm tracking, you do not need the controllers to play around in this HMD unless you are in PCVR
120hz at low resolutions

I am coming from a Rift-s and I al NOT impressed. the rift-s was more comfortable and included a premium strap and had display port. so Meta took that away for just slightly upgraded screens. hell the only good upgrade was the lenses
sorry if I hurt your feelings......LOL NO im not.",3
Monitor +; Speakers -,"I can't speak more highly of the monitor. It is very clear and really what I was looking for when I bought it. However, the speakers are another subject. Try as I may.... actually my son tried, who is very computer savvy tried to get speakers to work. He spent lots of time and they still did not connect. Amazon even sent me a replacement monitor after he tried to get them to work. Ditto. The speakers again didn't work. The new computer could not find the speakers to connect, so I ended up buying external ones. All in all, I am happy with the monitor, but as already said wouldn't buy if you were looking for internal speakers.",3
"Great panel on a budget, frustrating KVM and input switching","Lets start with the good, if all you want is a nice panel that won't break the bank. This works great. Looks awesome in games, very little input latency, HDR content. etc etc, its an OLED, just get it if its in your budget. Most people will likely not have any issues with this thing. The primary functionality of displaying stuff is good.

Okay now the bad, its long because it needs to be. This won't apply to everyone, but if you want to use the KVM / USB dock, or simply want to switch inputs between two or more plugged in devices, keep reading...

Starting with the KVM / USB Dock issues. This could potentially burn in your monitor over time if you aren't careful. I won't gripe about it too much since this can be fixed with an external KVM / Dock

Keep in mind, this issue depends on your devices or input configuration but, I've got a run of the mill Windows laptop plugged in over USB C, and a PC plugged in over Displayport. This issue all starts when the laptop goes to sleep, the monitor switches to the PC that is also plugged in. Well, that disconnects the dock from the laptop, which in turn wakes it up causing it to reconnect to the monitor and switch between inputs in a slow but infinite loop! If you don't catch this behavior, your monitor could very well be burning in from this over time without you even noticing why.

Okay for basic input switching functionality, I'm not going easy on them for on this. Even $5 monitors from 25 years ago found at goodwill on their last leg do a better job than this thing. How is it this bad?

Like almost any monitor, you can manually select inputs in the OSD, there is an automatic input feature and each discrete input can also be selected. The auto feature is fine if you want that. If you want to manually select an input with more than one thing plugged in, good luck and keep reading...

Okay first, not as bad, but not great. If you manually switch inputs, and the display 'sees' a black screen, ie. from a second display on a windows login. Its technically an active input, just the entire screen is black. The monitor will automatically switch inputs to the previous one after only 1-2 seconds afterwards, even if you specifically told it what input you want to use in the OSD.

This improves a little if active content is on the input you are switching to, but still this thing struggles daily for me. It will inconsistently switch the input back to the previous one, even if content is on the input you are switching to. I constantly have to unplug the DP cable on the back to get around this. On top of all this, about once a week, the monitor needs a full power cycle to successfully switch inputs at all, even after you physically unplug all but the one input you want, simply just a terrible experience.

Here is the thing, if a monitor or any screen really has an option to manually set the input, it should stay on that input regardless if there is any input at all, at least for an extended period of time. Realistically, it should always be on the input you selected. They absolutely dropped the ball on this simple feature, in my circumstances its infuriating.",3
"Good for media and gaming, bad for producitivty","Pros:

- Solid build quality, no flex or creaking
- HDR video content looks amazing, deep blacks, huge contrast range, vibrant colors
- Built in (basic) KVM makes switching between a gaming desktop and a work laptop easy for example

Cons:

- My unit had a cluster of dead sub pixels about an inch from the corner (probably about 1.5 pixels worth), and a dead sub-pixel right in the middle of the display
- Extremely poor viewing angles for an IPS, glow very noticeable in the corners
- Sleep mode buggy, sometimes required power cycle to get the video back (tested on multiple computeres)
- USB-PD not working on one of my laptops, possibly due to low wattage
- The matte texture finish was too coarse for 4K in my opinion

Summary:

It's really hard to recommend this monitor to anybody due to it not waking up from sleep mode. If you only game and watch videos, this monitor may be an decent option for you, but I would not consider it for productivity/office work due to the poor viewing angles, text looks washed out near the edges of the screen at arms length.",3
Scroll Wheel Broken,"Decent mouse, very lightweight and great polling rate. However the scroll click is misaligned after only a month and doesn't click properly, just after the return window.",2
after having this 6 months :(,"Looks way better than the other one I had of its same model look but the problem with this one is... the right clicker is loose and every time I click it, it gets hooked on the scroller's edge of the frame. So I can't click it well or fast enough and I screw up my gameplay 99% of the time. I love but hate this mouse, it might be a flaw. It does work when it does click and everything else works perfectly
The shipping was fast, packaged well and it came in a reusable tube with a clip-on lid. I’m also happy they still make this model because I’m so used to this shape and don't want to get use to a new one again.",2
It could be way better.,"After using both 1 and 2 and then going to a razer viper v3, it is night and day different. I’m not a fan of razers software but only having to use it to set the dpi and update the firmware makes me not care about that. The superlight 1 was great, and 2 was honestly a disappointment for me. I was hoping we’d get rid of the weight addition on the bottom of the mouse and replace it with a skate similar to the front. Why have a mouse that’s designed to be SUPERLIGHT to still have a place for a weight to go? One of the biggest things I’ve noticed after switching to the Viper is the bottom skates also have a tighter tolerance and don’t get debris stuck causing scratches, they’re also just way thicker. Optical switches that are extremely loud, which I don’t think is the optical switches themselves but Logitech has changed their manufacturing somehow. The first version is not as stiff nor loud. This may be a personal issue but has caused fatigue.

I don’t mean for this to sound like an ad for razer, but Logitech has literally made the decision to not improve their product in ways that actually matter. I use mine as a very light paper weight.",2
Silly Potato,"I have owned a few Logitech devices over the years. When I told my wife I was going to try one of their high end gaming mice she was like ""oh, honey... are you sure?"" I'm a calm dude. I meditate, and do yoga every day. I have put a Logitech keyboard over my knee in a fit of rage, and hurled a mouse into a water feature in two separate incidents.

HOWEVER, I'd read good reviews for this particular mouse, and the review checking software onboard my browser seemed to think they were legitimate.

It's my bad for not checking first, but I honestly didn't think you could buy a five button wireless mouse for over a hundred USD that didn't have Bluetooth. It's fine, using a big branded black dongle nub and/or cable with my pristine Lenovo Legion in Glacier White is fine. I ordered the mouse to have a matching aesthetic, but it's fine. ಠ_ರೃ

I resolved to give the mouse a genuine chance. Each time it drove me to rage or otherwise offended my sensibilities I would utter the phrase ""Silly Potato"" in reference to the mouse. 5 Silly Potatoes, and I ask for a refund.

Silly Potato #1: The support page link included in the manual doesn't exist.
Silly Potato #2: Logitech wants to scrape my corpse for marketing data in exchange for support. I am generally okay with this, but ugh. At least let me try the product I bought before looting my body.
Silly Potato #3: To update the Firmware you need to plug in both the mouse, and the starkly contrasting dongle nub. There's no detail telling the user what was actually done. It just makes a little icon vanish in the update wizard. That's how proud of their software they are... updated, but also, nothing to see here.
Silly Potato #4: The software scrapes your hard drive for data without consent (it's probably buried in the 1393 pages ToS/EULA, but I digress, this felt really bad to me).
Silly Potato #5: You can't switch the DPI on the mouse without the software running. Unless, you have a cheap $12 mouse with a physical DPI button also plugged in.

Silly Potato is probably getting sent back for a refund.

I'm going to try the key assignment feature and see how it handles for gaming and productivity. Will update this review in a few.",2
Great mouse with terrible software,"The mouse is awesome, super lightweight and exactly what you would want from a wireless mouse. I have no gripes with the mouse itself, in my opinion its one of the best out there. The main problem comes from the terrible Logitech G Hub software that you need to install in order to change the dpi. The program is so terrible that it doesn't even qualify as a joke. It hardy works and will randomly change your dpi in game. In the program there are profiles for every game you have installed with individual dpi settings per game. That doesn't make any sense in the first place but you would think if you just change the dpi (in the game you wanna plays profile) then it would work. It doesn't. I would have it set to a certain dpi on my desktop AND the games profile, and it would STILL randomly change to different dpis during the game. It's unreal. The mouse is perfect however and if they just scrapped the terrible program they use and start a fresh one it could seriously be the perfect mouse.",2
Great mouse for maybe a year at most,"The mouse itself is great, but they send it with the grip tape not on and rely on stickers to get the job done. Made it to October before the adhesive from the stickers oozed out and eventually made it into the actual mouse components making it almost unusable. The stickers were always sliding around as well. Terrible flaw that ends up ruining what could be a perfect mouse. You can use alcohol to clean it off from the surface easy enough but it makes the mouse wheel almost stuck in place and the actual left and right click don't like to spring back up after being pressed because they are basically glued down. Alcohol also very quickly dissolves the polish they have on the mouse glide pads so if you happen to get even a spec of alcohol on any of the pads, your mouse will cease to glide at all. Only buy if you can comfortably function it without lift because without any grip at all, smooth polished rounded edges everywhere, most people won't be able to lift the mouse off during fast paced movements in fps or moba/rts reliably.",2
"Great Mouse, Terrible Quality Control...","I got this mouse around two weeks ago and at first, it was amazing. All the buttons were nice and crisp, the shape is really ergonomic and nice to hold when gaming. However, within a week something within the mouse became loose and the mouse started to serve a secondary purpose of being a maraca. I didn't throw this mouse around or anything but the fact that something (most likely the battery) became loose miffed me off. I decided to return it and get another model since I thoroughly enjoyed the mouse, however, the second model ended up having a mouse scroll wheel issue where when scrolled down, it would be stiffer and make an odd sound. Now this made me even more annoyed but I decided the third time was the charm right? So I ended up ordering another mouse and today it arrived only for the mouse scroll wheel issue to not be there, but the left mouse button sounded drastically off from the right mouse button and made a more metallic pining noise for whatever reason. You could say this is a minor issue if the mouse works but when I'm spending $170 on a mouse, I expect all components of the mouse to be of a high quality and not be drastically different from the same exact models I had in hand. Now I have to decide whether I want to return my third superlight in a row or just suck it up and use a subpar unit. Really disappointed about how good this mouse can be, but because of the differences in qualities between units, you're essentially going into a lottery in trying to get a decent-quality unit.",2
Get ready to lose your mind when you have to update the firmware.,"You would expect a company like logitech to make this simple, nope they sure dont! Had to google why my mouse suddenly stopped working after I updated the firmware for it through G HUB. It took me a good HOUR after I did to find out the solution and get it working again. Very frustrating to say the LEAST. It was great right out the box, then the company logitech themselves suggest you use there software and update the firmware of it! Well greaty maybe include that when you do update the mice firmware it's going to stop working until you solve it yourself!!! Great mouse, really shit software if I say myself and everyone else that also had this issue. Was all over reddit this same issue I ran into so luckily I could research and fix it in the end... but wow what a waste of time logitech....",2
keys do NOT last!,"Bought my first one and it lasted just under a year...the L side shift key became sticky and randomly typed capital letters. I cleaned it, researched and popped key off, got it to work another month or so before it gave up completely. I was told ""practically disposable"" and not worth cost of repair. But I was very happy with the feeling, use, and connectivity to my MacBook. Yes. I bought another.
This next keyboard has only lasted 4months and the L shift key is again sticking. I have been very conciencious about whether I lean on that key etc, and I don't! I haven't spilt or eaten on it. again popped off and cleaned, didn't see anything but it worked another couple weeks and started in again.
I've purchased another keyboard, cheaper but Apple compatible. Even if this new one only lasts a year, at least I will have only spent 1/3 of the price!
Very disappointed. I like the look, feel, function, quick connectivity, easy set up...but not worth the $ when it won't even last a year!!
Not worth the $ unfortunately.",2
Defective Keyboard. Bluetooth Spotty! Manufacturer or Merchant selling defective product?,"Defective. It is hit or miss. Even at Full charge, the keyboard would hang up and keep typing characters endlessly - these are characters I did not press. And it does this constantly..introducing endless space into my document. it takes shutting it down and rebooting computer to have it reset, but does this again after a week or two. This is so frustrating. The whole idea of using a bluetooth was so I didn't have it connected and have freedom, defeats the objective. I am going back to my usb connected keyboard. I also bought a trackpad at the same time and it looses connection too, I am beginning to think maybe this merchant has defective products. Unfortunately outside of the return window else I would have returned it. Next tiem i will by my apple product directly from apple moving forward.",2
Disappointed with Apple,"Bought this keyboard October of 2023. It's now June, 15, 2024 and the space bar key is malfunctioning. I take particular of ALL my computer - no abuse, no spilled liquid, never dropped or abused in any matter or means. Being used on iMac Retina 27"" 5K 2020 model. Suddenly when space bar key was pressed would not create a space between words. This happens ""sporadically"". Sometimes it works correctly.........other times (mostly) it doesn't. To me ""quality"" is determined by how well and ""how long"" a product continues to function. SEVEN MONTHS is way to short of time for this malfunction to be occurring. (Maybe 7 YEARS but not 7 months!!) Take your chances folks........",2
Not worth the money,"I've owned this keyboard for almost 8 months now. I was fairly excited to get this when it came as typically enjoy apple products in regards to their product design and functionality. I waited this long to post for two reasons. 1) This keyboard did't impress me all that much, but it has to do more with my preferences than it does with the actual keyboard. In my opinion the keys are placed a little narrowly, and they click and clack a lot. I've bee a logitech keyboard user for years. The keyboard I've most enjoyed is the logitech wireless solar K750. Everything about it just fits with me and you don't have to every charge it. The lights in your office charge the battery. The K750 comes in a mac and a PC version, so you don't lose any functionality with your shortcut keys. It has all the same functionality of the apple keyboard and it's half the price.
2) This is the biggest reason I decided to write this review. I'm 8 months in and the freakin ""n"" button started missing about every third time I typed it. Thats just great! It's so annoying. $129 for an inferior product. It does look good next to my magic mouse and mac mini however.",2
If you type 120+wpm you will hate this keyboard.,"DON'T BELIEVE EVERYONE
Everybody says this keyboard is great. It is not. I type 158wpm at 96% accuracy. I have tried a LOT of keyboards.
q6 max, Magic Keyboard, Logitech mx key, mx key s, and others. I have issues with all of them, but the mx key s is so hyped for no reason. The keys squeak. They won't on day1, but they will on day10. Very frustrating. That isn't why I don't like it though. The battery life is awful, and it reduced my accuracy and typing speed.

The 158wpm was on the Magic Keyboard. Yeah it doesn't have great elevation, no backlight keys, and they will tire out your wrists. But it is much, much better than the Logitech. The Logitech is just poorly made. It feels good out of the box but after a few days of typing on it you will find that the keys are very difficult to press. You have to exert a lot of effort to type on this keyboard, it doesn't feel smooth and natural. I hate it. Returning asap.",2
Unusable,"Looked fine out of the box, sleek design. However, I’m not sure if the case itself is ungrounded or just the hdmi port. As soon as I tried to use external audio a buzz came through my speakers. After many trips trying different fixes, I bought a Samsung monitor from Best Buy and there is zero ground hum through it. Luckily the return process is simple. If you are doing any kind of audio recording or production I would look elsewhere.",2
Kinda bummed...,"At first glance, this product seemed very promising. Setting it up and connecting it was relatively easy. However, when I turned it on, I was struck by how bright the monitor was; the brightness and contrast were so intense that they washed out everything. The images in the listing do not accurately represent the product. I've tried adjusting all the settings, but I still can't achieve a good balance between color and brightness. I'm unsure if I will return it or try to get used to it. I will provide an update later.",2
Don’t recommend,"Very cheap panel, makes the display tint very often to yellow with night light, images are also not very clear. I recommend going to a marketplace and seeing if you can get a better used monitor for the same price.. you really can’t get a good new monitor for this price, unless you buy a used one.",2
Washed Out Image,"What is there not to like about a sub $100 monitor that is anti-glare? Right out of the box, the image is washed out. I had low expectations for a $100 monitor but this fell well below my expectations. My normal process when buying any new monitor is to visit color calibration websites and manually adjust the display. The problem is this display when next to a proper display (such as my LG LG 32QN650-B (as Sub $300 1440p display) looks so bad I don't even want to use it. Furthermore, no amount of calibration can correct the image to something of reasonable quality. I'm stunned others rate this display so highly. I didn't even need to compare it to my LG to see how bad the display performed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. My previous Dell monitor lasted 15 years and costs $1,500 (back when HD displays cost $$$). That was a great display. This one should be pulled from the market.",2
Yarf City,"The pros:
Great screen that has the ability to show some great visuals.
When games work and I am not nauseous I am having fun.
The cons:
Lagging constantly through any app or form of connection to PC, that would not be so bad if the reaction to lag was anything other than violent shaking of the screen that instantly makes you nauseous.
Connectivity is an issue, if I want to use standalone Quest games the graphics are poor but connecting to a PC directly with a cable causes lag (may be an issue with my PC but I have no issues with any games I played before the Quest)
Uncomfortable to wear for more than a couple minutes. If you want to use to theater like ability good luck with the immediate headache from the pressure to keep it at the right level with you eyes so the visuals are not blurry (I do wear glasses and am using the glasses extender).
Nausea is more of an issue with me but is mostly related to the lagging shaking the VR world around me. Stationary games like Beat Saber are fine and I can handle the seizure like activity because it only lasts 30 so seconds.
If you want to sit and play you will have an issue with your avatar not being at the standard height and if you drop something you are expected to bend over and grab it. I am sure there is a fix with this adjusting the floor height in your settings.

Overall it is really an issue with connecting to my PC to load the games. I used the Steam Link app but the graphics are horrid. The Air Link causes an insane amount of lag to the point where the games are not playable. Using a 20ft USB to USB-C cable is so far the best method but still had huge lag issues that cause the entire game to slow and the world shake around you.
I would recommend this headset to someone who has too much money in their pocket and is not serious about gaming. They would also have to have 20+ years of fighter pilot experience to handle the nausea. Maybe someone with a younger more beefed up PC and supreme internet connection has had a better time.",2
Display is very blurry!!,"I've been an avid VR user for over 4 yrs, buying my own Quest 3 from Amazon, without an issue. I own 2 Quest 2 headsets as well. One is my 28 yr old daughter's... but now the Quest 2 is becoming obsolete... so, I bought her a Q3S as its such a more affordable option. It came extremely quickly!! Overnight!! I immediately went to set it up for her, but could barely make out any text on the screen. I searched for settings, but there are NONE... & there are no settings on the app either to adjust the display or frame rate. I then clicked on the help button here on the Amazon app, and it instructed me to change the settings on the app. THOSE settings are obviously meant for the Quest 3! NOT the 3S. So I kindly advise Amazon and/or Meta to change those instructions ASAP! My daughter has very poor vision to begin with, & wears very high rx glasses. I gave it to her to try it out for herself. She gave it back & told me to return it immediately. Very upsetting, being that she & I love using our Quest headsets. But now I'm going to have to just get her a Quest 3...or just wait till her Quest 2 dies & see what new headset is put by then. I have a friend who also just purchased a 3S and has the same issue with blurriness...and is also returning hers. Ive spoken to 2 other people with the same issue. Maybe we all got Lemons? Idk.
Thank god Amazon has 0% financing available, which meta has as well on its website.. but purchasing ANYTHING from Amazon is superbly better, by far, than any other platform online, simply due to its next day delivery & extremely easy return policy! For that I do commend Amazon! Hopefully Meta can recall any blury headsets now and correct the issue, or give new replacement headsets. I've heard the majority of the vr community who bought the 3S have had fantastic results. So.. who knows.",2
 A disappointment…Maybe.,"I originally pre-ordered this from HTC and it included the PCVR cable kit as part of the pre-order. The release date came and they had no idea when my order would ship so I cancelled my order with HTC and ordered from Amazon. Not thinking about the pre-order deal it arrived with no cable kit. My fault, I’ll admit to that. So I had to order the PCVR cable kit for an additional $150.00 (+tax) and was told my order for that will not ship until late November. So I have the $999.00 Vive headset that I can’t use as a PCVR device. The unit is standalone but as I have several VR headsets that are standalone that was not the purpose of this purchase.
Likes:
SD card slot for expanded storage (Up to 2TB on card).
Eye tracking (with available face tracking for $99.00).
Automatic IPC adjustment.
Vivid colors and large field of view.
Hot swapable battery.
Dislikes:
Fresnel lenses. (for this price it should have had pancake lenses).
Comfort (Not a light as my Meta 3).
Price (for this price you could buy 2 Meta 3’s with 512G storage and have family fun).
Last generation CPU (Snapdragon 1 instead of the faster Snapdragon 2 found on the Meta 3).
Built in storage is only 128Gig and that can run out fast with AAA games.
Controllers have rings on them ala Meta 2 type controllers.
Vive store does not come close to the Meta store as far as content.
Hand tracking does not seem as precise as Meta’s.
So, my go-to VR headset is still my Meta 3 and if and when I can do PCVR I will come back and edit this review and if warranted give it a higher score.

EDIT: Finally received my $150.00 cable kit for PCVR. Finding the headset to be very flimsy and uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour. Not the simplest plug and play on the cable kit to, so no, I will not increase my rating. This thing is WAY overpriced for what you get in functionality. My go to is still going to be the Meta Quest 3 that costs less than half this price and is a far more advanced headset.",2
"Piece of Crap - useless as a doorbell, useless as a security camera","I'd give it zero stars if that were an option.

First of all, the system is just WAY TOO SLOW!. By the time a video loads, whoever was at your door is long gone.

Door bell does not ring inside the house unless it's hard wired to a preexisting chime. What good is a doorbell that doesn't ring inside the house?

Activity recording at your door is hit or miss. Sometimes it gets recorded - sometimes not. I've often opened my door to discover that a package has been delivered, but no alert from Blink and no recording.

Doorbell eats expensive lithium batteries. Two year claimed battery life is an outright lie. Two months is more like it. I just had to install the third set of batteries in the 5 months I've owned the thing. New Energizer AA's read 1.8 volts - when the system tells you that you need to replace the batteries, they still read 1.5 volts, so, I suppose I could reuse them in another device...

System went ""off line"" after 5 months and is now no longer recording activity at the door. I'm getting alerts on my phone, but when I open the app it says ""No Recent Activity"" and nothing has been recorded. Even when it was working, the videos are so slow to load that you get recordings of what happened - not what's happening in real time.

The system is also triggered by events far outside the activity zone. I got lots of videos of cars passing by in the street - way outside of the activity zone. This, of course, helps to drain the batteries.

Don't waste your money - buy something else.

Update:

After posting my initial review, I was contacted by Kevin from Blink customer service. Kevin requested permission to review my system logs - which I granted. After reviewing the logs, Kevin said that my doorbell appeared to be defective and sent me a replacement.

I installed the replacement doorbell and saw some slight improvement - in that I was seeing less false alarms from cars driving by.

The latency (which is, apparently built into the system) makes it pretty much useless as a doorbell or as a security device.

Notifications are still hit or miss.

A few anecdotal examples: The other day I had two events scheduled. Someone from my lawyer's office was coming by with some papers for me to sign. I was also expecting someone to come by to test the fire alarms. The fire alarm people had given themselves a 8:30 AM to 4:00 PM window to show up. So, I was, periodically, opening my front door to see if they were in the area. On one occasion I opened the door to find a young lady from the law office standing on my stoop. She had pressed the doorbell, but Blink told me nothing. If I hadn't been checking for the fire alarm people, I would have missed her. Later I heard someone banging on my door and opened it to find the fire alarm people had arrived.

Reviewing the recordings later, I found that the young lady from the law office had walked up and rung the doorbell - there was a video and audio recording of her ringing the bell. Blink, however, told me NOTHING,

The fire alarm guy had also rung the doorbell and when he got no response, pounded on the door. Video and audio recording shows him ringing the doorbell - all I heard was the pounding on the door - in both instances, because of the latency in the system, the notification on my phone must have come after I had already answered the door.

Another time, I heard someone pounding on the door. When I opened the door I found that the mailman had walked up to my door, dropped off a package and pounded on the door. No notification from Blink and no recording - no NOTHING.

A few days later, the ""new"" doorbell went ""offline"" (again). Troubleshooting guide said to remove the batteries, wait a while and then reinstall them. No effect, so I pulled the batteries again and checked the voltage with a multimeter. One battery read 1.5V and the other read 1.45V, so I replaced them both. Blink did not give me a low battery warning - just went ""offline."" I've had the Blink ""doorbell"" for 9 months. This is now the FIFTH time I've had to replace the batteries! So, the ""new"" doorbell is eating batteries just as fast as the original ""defective"" doorbell was. Two months, MAX! To reiterate, the ""Two year"" battery life claim is a flat out lie.

The doorbell was now ""working"" again. Unfortunately, I was again getting notifications, but no recordings - Just the ""No Recent Activity"" response (again).

After futzing around with it for a couple of days to no effect, I though maybe I'd try unplugging the Sync unit and then plugging it back in. After plugging it back in, the Sync paired with the doorbell and I am, once again getting recordings of whoever WAS (as in the past tense) at my door - nothing you are able to view in real time.

Bought a Fire HD tablet which would, supposedly, work with the Blink to allow me hear the doorbell and view whoever was at the door, but it turns out that the Fire HD shuts itself off after a few minutes of inactivity, so that was, again, useless. Finally bought an Echo Dot and now I get an audio ""someone is at your front door"" alert when someone presses the doorbell. So, I've ended up spending another $150.00 just to try to get the damned thing to ring inside the house - which, by definition, is what a doorbell is supposed to do.

Again, however, there is so much latency built into the system, that whoever was at your door is, most likely, long gone before you can find your phone, open the app and pull up a video to see who is (was) there.

To say I am extremely disappointed with the Blink ""doorbell"" is a gross understatement. I'm flat out pissed off with the damned thing. The advertising copy implying that you will be able to have a video and audio conversation with the smiling people at you door is just outright fraud. The advertising copy about the Blink ""doorbell"" is blatant false advertising.

Update 11.22.24:

If the above wasn't bad enough, to add insult to injury, I'm now getting f'ing ads for other Blink crap when I open the app in response to a notification... POS.

Update 12.27.24

""Doorbell"" went off-line (yet again) yesterday. I kept getting Notifications on my phone, but when I open the app it just said ""No Recent Activity"" (again) and no video clips had been recorded.

Figured it was probably the batteries (again), so I pulled the doorbell and checked the batteries with a voltmeter. One read 1.63v and the other read 1.62v - so, they should have still been good. System cryptically told me that the batteries were ""OK"" (very helpful).

So, I reinstalled the batteries - no go. Next, I figured I'd try unplugging the sync module and restarting it - worked once before, so why not give it a try? Still no go. Sync module now will no longer connect with WiFi - even though it is sitting, literally, right beside my router.

Figured I 'd try replacing the batteries even though they still read good - again, no joy.

System is now completely off-line. No notifications, no recordings, no nothing. System will no longer connect to WiFi, which means it's not connecting with Alexa or my Echo Dot.

Nothing works. I, once again, have an ""ornamental"" video doorbell which doesn't record video and only rings outside the house.

I really cannot express how pissed-off, and disappointed I am with this poorly designed, poorly implemented, and poorly supported POS. It, simply, doesn't do ANYTHING that their advertising copy claims it does.

Useless as a video doorbell, hell, it doesn't even wort as a doorbell, doorbell.",1
A years experience with one clear winner! Its not the one your thinking either!,"I have never such an indebt review, but I spent a whole year going through doorbells. I will start from the beginning of my experience. I will list the 3 main doorbells I bought, Why I bought them, what I didn't like about them and why I returned them and the refund process.

This is what I was looking for in a doorbell. Also, I learned through out the process what was more important for my needs. It needed to be Wireless for easy insulation. Good night vision. Good AI detection, a separate chime for indoor, remote monitoring, a long lasting battery, Elderly friendly & easy to use, and one of the most important needs were budget. I didn't want to spend a big amount on the doorbell, Then, spend money on a app, cloud subscription, separate chime, & Alexa. I was buying these for my grandparents. They do not understand having subscriptions for everything nowadays, but has to be easy to understand and use.

EKEN wireless doorbell and Chime; Bought on February 13, 2023. The reasons I bought it were, said it was free and no subscription, indoor chime, and the price. After buying this one I really learned what was important and if things seem to good to be true they probably are, duh right. First off, the app is free to downloads but is not free after that. There is a monthly app fee and cloud storage free. Also, the app is a Chinese app. its complicating and not user friendly. I got notifications every time a car went by. it was annoying. I only could see the street. It didn't show any of my drive but the very end. Only worked with 2.4 Wi-Fi. You could only have one indoor chime connected and it was not loud enough. One of my most annoying facts about this doorbell was I had to charge it every week! I live in rural area and I couldn't imagine how soon I would have to charge living in the city. I returned EKEN on September 19, 2023 because it quit working. It would no longer connect to the internet or the chime. it was frozen for weeks. In the end I'm glad it gave out because it was really more of a nightmare and not free like they say! I paid $46 for this doorbell.

Blink Wired/Wireless Doorbell; Bought on July 31, 2023. I really had high hopes for this one. This one was the most misleading, very vague information, and the hardest to get a refund on. This is not a wireless Doorbell. For it to really work with out an Alexa, google home or some kind of in home system you have to wire it. There is no indoor Chime. You are not told about Sync Module when buying. The app is free but cloud storage is not and you need locally storage with the Sync Module 2 and USB drive (each sold separately). I was not aware of this when I bought it. However, with out an Alexa I couldn't even get it set up and use it and get the local storage later. I thought we could use the app like every other doorbell but with out the Alexa you will get no notifications. It doesn't say when I returned it, but I remember them telling me after a non-pleasant- conversation to keep the product and we will refund you. If you are wondering... no, you can not take it home and hook it up to your Alexa. they disable it unfortunately , 😒🤣. I paid $60 for this.

Eufy Security, Battery Video Doorbell C210 Kit, Wi-Fi Connectivity, 1080p, 120-Day Battery, No Subscription, AI Detection, Wireless Chime Included, 2-Way Audio, Remote Monitoring for Apartment Living; Bought on November 5, 2023. I waited till the doorbell died for the first time to write the review. after the first one it was really important to me for it to have a reasonable length in a battery! I charged it for the first time for a good amount of time. The first's charge is always the most important on any battery powered electronics. It died on 2/15/24. The battery lasted 100 days with moderately amount of use. I am very happy with it. It does not take long to charge back up either. I am not getting a notification every time a car goes by either. The AI in the doorbell works really well on telling me when someone is here or when there is activity. Great night vision. One of my Favorite is it came with a free angle piece! so I see my whole driveway and street. The house is a normal ranch house so the driveway is 'normally' placed 😂 none of the other doorbells came with a angle piece and the insulation looks great. There is a piece it snaps in-to, so, no thief can run off with it and protects it from water. Moreover, ITs free! The app is free and the chime is also a storage device! The chime is loud and has more then one chime. I did have to buy a memory card for the storage. In the reviews I read it said It has to be SanDisk 128GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - 120MB/s, C10, U1, Full HD, A1, Micro SD Card - SDSQUA4-128G-GN6MA. You can have a lower GB but nothing higher then 128GB. I have had no problems with it its just a basic memory card but works great with doorbell. I have had no problems with doorbell or local storage and chime. The app is super elderly friendly and easy to use. the company brags about being budget friendly. Eufy says, ""No Subscription Required: Designed to protect your home as well as your wallet, Eufy security products are one-time purchases that combine security with convenience."" I have no complaints with this product. I had to spend more money with this one but because I don't have to pay for a subscription, app fee, and cloud storage (storage is after the moment of doorbell going off being able to see it) I paid $99.99 with a $20 coupon. The memory card was $13.88. With doorbell and everything included, memory card, and coupon & tax; I paid $100.91.

I Know this a long review, but if I could save someone a year of wasting time on doorbells I hope I can help!",1
" Total garbage. These are not ""Security"" cameras. They're toys for spotting wildlife.","Oh boy where do I begin. I've had Blink for about 2 and a half years now, and that's 2 and a half years too long. The main thing that drove me to this in the first place was that I didn't have to hardwire anything, and setup was very easy. I could deal with paying a subscription in place of dealing with setup. I have 3 outside cameras, and one doorbell cam. Heres a list of problems I've had with it, but first I'll start with the pros.

- Relatively affordable

- Easy to install and setup

- Pretty modest battery life. I did not use any solar options.

- Links up with Alexa

That's it. Every other ""pro"" I can think of isn't exclusive to this system. The bare minimum is not a pro, such as being waterproof or having notification snooze. Now lets start with the cons.

- Absolutely AWFUL motion detection. It's honestly baffling. It can't spot a car going down the road which takes up a quarter of the camera but can spot a shadow of a tree branch moving a quarter of a mile away. Can't capture the mailman coming up to my door. Can't capture a car parking right in my driveway, AKA almost the entirety of my Driveway cam. Can't capture people walking on my front lawn. Oh! But it can capture a bug on the shed! Sometimes I get alerts and I see no movement at all. Straight up phantom recordings. I've played with the sensitivity, and there is no sweet spot between capturing actual movement and capturing literally nothing at all and alert spamming my phone.

- Detection zones simply do not work. At my first house, I have the entirety of the road blocked off from detection, yet it captures every single car passing my house. I have just the bottom third of my doorbell camera not greyed out for visitors or people in my yard. (Can't capture them, though!)

- MAJOR ISSUE - retrigger time. It has a MINIMUM of 10 seconds. What the F? Why is zero not an option? If someone is actually trespassing on my property and the recording stops, they have a 10 second window to do something or move somewhere and I am none the wiser. I've contacted Blink about this and they simply have no desire to reduce or remove this """"""feature"""""". These cameras could be 100% perfect, but having this feature would immediately make me discard these. I'm a moron for keeping them this long.

- ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE - The amount of time it takes to view a camera as I get an alert. Dude, I purchased a doorbell camera. I should immediately be able to view who's at my door the second I get the notification that it was rang or motion was detected. How long does it take, though? Roughly an entire minute. More than enough time for someone to think nobody is home and leave. Absolutely worthless piece of technology. What's the point of allowing someone to talk through the cameras when this is the response time? I should mention, my docking station is probably 15 feet away from the doorbell.

- ""End recording when movement stops"". Yes please, sounds like a great way to get the maximum recording time. Except this feature also does not work. Not only will recording start when say, a deer, is standing in the middle of the camera's view (straight up disregarding any portion of the deer walking into frame. Sensitivity set to 9 btw!) but will end when the deer stays still for half a second, or even when the deer is still moving! My only other option is to set clip length to 60 sec which straight up kills the battery life. Sometimes I can get lucky and see the delivery guy walk up to my porch, but recording will end as he is still walking. Again, what the actual heck is wrong with this system.

- This might be on me, but my storm door swung open on a particularly windy day, and hit my doorbell cam. The cam immediately broke and I can't be bothered to replace it because I don't even want it anymore. May I also say my storm door is captured by a spring so I can't imagine it even hit the camera particularly hard.

So that's it. Nearly everything this camera system has to offer just sucks or flat out does not work. There has been only one time in my entire time owning them where I was glad I had it, but even then I was blessed with it's pitfalls and discouraged that I could not have a longer clip. I moved, and brought the cameras with me as a temporary solution while I hardwire my house with CAT6 and get some proper security cameras. I don't even know what to do with these Blink ones when I get new cams. They're fun for capturing animals that sit 3 feet in front of the camera, but horrible for capturing humans, the entire reason why I bought these. I highly highly discourage anyone from buying these, and Blink/Amazon should be ashamed of this product.",1
The camera for cell phone graduates. That's all.,"I bought my first Kodak Brownie camera for $1 from Eastman Kodak in 1961. So began my interest and expenditures in many expensive cameras and accessories over the past 62 years as my interest and quest for the ultimate photo grew. My last high-end camera purchase ( not including my new Google Pixel 8 Pro cell phone and its well-promoted camera) was my Canon EOS 70D purchased in 2011 to capture the life of my new grandchild. It has the weight, the size, the smell, the feel, and the performance of a well-made technical marvel, whether I chose to calculate my own settings or shoot on automatic all day to capture a high-speed toddler. Either way, the results were something to be proud of. As every photographer knows, cameras, like cell phones, are upgraded every year, often sooner, to keep us spending money and wanting the latest and greatest in our possession. Sure I wanted the Canon EOS 80D, then the 90D, and then the next series up, but honestly the improvements were now minimal and not worth the investment so I remained happy with my 70D, still am. Very recently, at age 74, I got hooked on all the advertising and YouTube promoters rallying around the next ""wave"" of digital cameras, the MIRRORLESS cameras, specifically the highly touted Canon R50 with 2 dedicated lenses, one everday 18-45mm zoom and one 50-210mm zoom to capture those special and far-away shots. These cameras and YouTubers promised amazing results whether shooting stills or videos, a must for any new content creator, because of its ability to focus so fast, annoying blur was a thing of the past, especially for those doing instructional videos and holding up products at different distances for the viewer see close-up. And videos of high-speed kids, animals, and cars staying in focus no matter what suddenly appeared in front of the lens. At 74, I decided I needed to treat myself to one more camera and experience this next level of automatic photography and focusing for myself. The megapixels and dual cmos focusing were nearly the same as my older 70D, but the possibility of perfection loomed within my reach so I ordered up the kit with some protective UV filters bring the whole investment to about $1100. Not the most money you can spend on a camera, not exactly cheap either, it's a good amount and you should get a lot for your money. Delivery day came and I began to worry when the outer box holding the camera and lenses was small and weighed almost nothing. Sure enough, I opened the outer box and inner camera kit was light as a feather, I felt sure someone had removed the equipment inside. But I was wrong. In the box was this ""tiny"" ( by comparison to my other Canon DSLR cameras) camera and two lenses made of such lightweight plastic it would collapse if I squeezed the shutter too hard. My large man-hands couldn't find a way to hold the camera comfortably or without having a finger in front of the lens. Speaking of lenses, the zoom lenses popped out to normal position and felt too top heavy and big for this lightweight camera. The R50 is meant for new cell phone graduates, had very few setting options, it's basically a point and shoot camera with good video capability. The diopter adjuster on the viewfinder so I didn't have to wear awkward glasses when composing didn't exist here, everything was blurry. And instead of built-in flash popping up when needed, it was suddenly 1970 again because I got a message while looking through the viewfinder that said ""open the flash"" which is a challenge because there is no button, just an ""edge"" to get a tiny fingernail in, so ridiculous. The camera disgusted me, I couldn't believe Canon built this toy and had the never to call it the next great camera and charge over $1000 for it! I wouldn't own this , even for free, it doesn't even begin to hold a candle to any of the great Canon DSLRs of the past. So I immediately put it back in the box and sent it back as I would never own a plastic, stripped camera like that, and if I did, I would never pay more than $25 for it, certainly not $1000, thus my overall one-star rating. I assume Canon has figured out a way to make it take decent pictures based on all the You Tube bragging going on, but it's definitely not for me. I'm pretty sure my new $1100 Google Pixel 8 Pro has a more complex camera system and takes better pics and videos. They're actually quite wonderful. And flagship Google cell phone weighs the same as 5 or 6 of those Canon R50s! You can decide for yourself if it is for you once you see it in person because videos and photos are misleading. Good luck.",1
 An absolute cash ploy to the customer!,"Many times it’s required to put the FX3 into a filming rig or a cage.

Doing so can clause wear and tear on the HDMI port door, or not allowed to let the door open completely which is not only inconvenient makes it unusable.

I know Sony camera before whether it’s the FX6 or any of the Alpha series cameras this has not been an issue!

To remove the HDMI door you have to remove five screws!

Four of the screws are not a concern, however…

The fifth and main screw that holds the HDMI port housing is put in with Loctite!

Which requires the customer to either strip the screw whitch will null and voids the warranty or have to send it across Canada to the only repair shop!

Shipping cost from Vancouver to Ontario doesn’t seem so bad until you added insurance $2.75 per hundred dollars

At $5000 insurance the shipping cost $150, just to have a technician removed one screw…

As a long time user and supporter of Sony I find this absolutely ridiculous!",1
 Buyer beware! Camera does NOT act as advertised,"Camera works ok in wifi mode. I did have difficulty during setup, like other people who have commented, but I did eventually get it to work. The app interface is just alright - nothing special and camera features in the app are arranged in a very clunky and non-intuitive fashion. This is just a learning burden for most people.
The instructions are written by a non-native English speaker, so interpretation of the instructions is hit-or-miss. This is certainly not the only product suffering from that aspect of instruction manuals, but still frustrating.
I am most unhappy with the difficulty to operate this camera in ""record without wifi"" mode as the description advertises. I absolutely DO NOT want the ""cloud services"" that this camera manufacturer is hell-bent on trying to sell. I want a camera that will record, without wifi enabled, to a micro SD card - just like the description advertised. My list of complaints around this subject: 1) I cannot get the camera to work without wifi. 2) When the SD card is inserted into the camera, the app tells me the SD card is not recognized...even after I just got done having the camera format the SD card!!!! 3) the number of advertisements for ""cloud services"" and ""cloud storage"" in the app and camera literature leads me to believe the camera manufacturer lied about the ability of this camera to record directly to the SD card without wifi enabled. That is a deal breaker for me.
My final complaint: it says right in the camera description that the camera is magnetic and will stick to metal surfaces. The one shipped to me will not magnetically ""stick"" to a steel surface, which I take to be yet another exaggerated lie about the product.",1
visual imaging is great but App is the worst!,"I've been using this camera for about two weeks, and I am a paid subscriber to the basic paid version.

The first week, everything worked great.

But since the start of the second week, the App has been flaky. For example, over the last three days, I go to bed with all events being recorded and correctly sorted by imaging A.I.

Then after awaking and having breakfast (with cars and people going past my windows for about an hour), I take my coffee to my home office, open the App to see what events had been recorded since last evening--and there are no events of any kind.

After trying this and that, it seems that after I get around to resetting the camera and resetting my subscription, that new events resume being added. But there are still no events showing for a ~12 hour overnight and early daylight period.

Worse is attempting to view events through my PC's online browsers (Google Chrome and MS Edge).

Again, the live view is fantastically good during both daylight and at night (despite the low outside lighting here), but trying to view events is a horror show.

For come reason, I have to fight with the settings to get the website to display the current day's events. Even when I try to clear everything, the original calendar setting returns eventually (which is the date I first installed the camera to yesterday's date).

When I try to set the online viewing website to the current day's date , the current date on the website's calendar appears surrounded by a faded blue circle instead of the solid blue I believe should be the color of a selected date, and as one might expect, no events are shown for the current date even though I had a few hours earlier viewed cars in my browser being tagged by the App as the cars go by.

I've tried both browsers, I've tried closing and opening the browsers, but as with the App itself, I eventually get it to work, I believe after resetting the camera and my paid subscription and restarting everything. But once it starts working, the missing overnight events remain missing.

And then when it works, it seems to only present the viewer using the website with events for the past two hours even though I set the event time parameter for the last 12 hours. Worst, when going through the thumbnails, the user reaches the last of that two hour's worth of thumbnails, and the thumbnails just start over again, apparently in an endless loop. The first few times I went through this, I didn't realize at first that I was seeing the same events a second time.

Also, I could swear that after the App updates, it changes one or more of the settings I made.

I've wasted hours fighting with this software and other nonsense.

It's a shame. Although I've only been using the camera for a short while, so I cannot attest to its durability, the hardware has nonetheless impressed, as has the accuracy of the artificial intelligence used to identify the various activities (possibly 97% accurate when it comes to images, though somewhat less when it comes to sounds). But that is then ruined by the Apps unreliability.

And yes, I do have an SSD card installed (Wyze brand card), and I have the App set to continually record everything the lens sees. But searching by time is nowhere near as convenient as searching and more time consuming than searching for an event (what time was it when I heard that noise outside, I think it woke me up about 3am).

So far, the best value of the camera is live viewing. Should something really important have happened, hopefully in a worst-case scenario, claiming a ladder to remove the SSD card from the camera and then sticking it into my PC might be more convenient for finding a recording of a particular incident that the App failed to save as an event.

UPDATE: my paid subscription continues to stop working once or twice a day. This most often occurs overnight. During such outages, my camera fails to record events of any kind. I have SSD cards in all cameras, which do seem to record everything, but scrolling through an SSD without events is tedious and worthless unless one is looking for a specific time.

I have the App installed on a Samsung Android Tablet and on a Moto G phone. When my subscription fails to work, both my phone and Samsung tablet stop recording events (though while the the SSD card in the camera also fails to record those events, it nonetheless does record continuous 24/7 video).

I have decided to buy another brand of cameras for outdoor surveillance.

I will continue to keep and use the three wyze camera's I already installed because they are more work to remove than the refund is worth.

As soon as I find a better camera brand, I will end my paid subscription to wyze and use them for nature watching and keeping an eye on my basement while recording 24/7 to SSD cards.

One more thing: I am powering this camera using the Wyze outdoor light fixture adapter. It's possible the problem is being caused by the adapter because I have another Wyze camera, albeit of an earlier version, on my back deck that is powered by an electric outlet adapter, and this Wyze camera records events faithfully (In seven months, maybe once or twice I had to reset the camera or unplug and replug it into the electrical outlet).

So the difference could be in the kind of adapter I'm using or it might be that the earlier Wyze version was more reliable than the newest version (V4) that I am using with the lamp socket adapter.",1
basic camera features are locked behind monthly subscription services,"It's a shame because this WYZE Cam v4 itself seems great, the night vision is cool, but I wish the app required to use the camera wasn't so restrictive. It just there to prevent you from doing things you should be able to do, without needing to utilize any type of cloud storage.
Without paying any extra money, you basically just get a feed to view the camera footage, and the ability to take screenshots or record video clips when you tell it to take a picture or record. This is fine, as the images and videos can be saved to a SD card. When it comes to anything else you want to do with the camera, the app gives one, or no, option, then all the others are all locked behind different subscription plans.
For example, the main thing you want a ""security camera"" for would have it automatically start to record a video when it senses motion. Well, out of the box, you can't do that with a WYZE Cam because it limits you to only save low quality thumbnails, not even ""HD"" images, to the SD card, with a frequency of once ever 5 minutes. So, in order for you to get a video of something occurring in real time, you need to get the notification on your phone, start the app, and then hit the record button to save what's going on. If they are going to limit the motion capture to thumbnails, being able to make the ""cooldown"" would be ok, but you can't. There is no option make the amount less, or even more. It's just one thumbnail every 5 minutes, unless you manually control it to take a picture or record.
Stuff like this goes for pretty much everything. You can choose from various automations and motion settings, but every time you choose something that's not the default or off, it up-sales you a subscription in order to activate.
If I actually needed this camera for a real-world application, like for actual security, I would have returned it on day one. I just wanted a camera just to be able to check in on a reptile enclosure, for when I'm not home. I'll continue to so I'll use it until I get something that isn't a scam to sell a live service I don't need.
I did find some third-party apps you can use with a WYZE Cam v4 that allow you to do some of the more basic things the WYZE app restricts, but they also hit or miss whether they work or not. It looks like WYZE blocks even these apps from accessing the camera feeds because I see a lot of reviews saying some app used to work and now, they don't, and I've also had this happen to me.
I noticed if you look at product listing, it never mentions needing an app to do any of the things it advertises. So technically it does do all those things it says, so it's not an outright scam, but it's still scam-like tactics. As the camera has the ability to do all the things it says and will so all in them in the most minimal way, but lock all customization behind a paywall, and leave that part out of the product page.
If I would have known the camera can't record on motion sensing, I would have tried another brand or paid more money for a better camera altogether. This is not an actual security camera. It's just a buy into a live service subscription.",1
"
Scam subscription clickbait trash","My previous experience with Wyze ""smart"" door locks and lamps - all affordable, entry-level technology - led me to purchase these cameras without hesitation - my mistake.

I ran one of these in my studio space for a few months without a subscription. During that time, I would get three or more alerts every night, at all hours. You can only capture one still photo per motion detection without a subscription, and none of those images ever gave a clue as to what was triggering the cameras. If you click on the image to try and zoom in, it takes you to their subscription page, and of course, the app gives you all kinds of ""notifications"" that are just ""upgrade! upgrade! upgrade!"" ads. The entire app interface feels like a clickbait ad platform. It's also truly buggy - constantly losing connection with the camera, and re-arming it when I turn it off remotely.

I set up rodent traps, covered all the windows to prevent any outdoor influences, talked to my neighbors, and almost got into it with my landlord when I told them something was moving in my space at night (they rightfully take pride in how clean, secure, and rodent-free their building is). After months of having no clue what was happening, I finally broke down and purchased a subscription to enable video capture.

Once Wyze had my credit card info, these mysterious events stopped dead.

I still get all the ""notifications"" to upgrade further to their ""pro"" subscription - no matter how many times you view the message, the notifications don't go away.

I'm sure Wyze will offer up some corporate BS about how my subscription offers ""false alarm detections"" or similar shameful excuses to explain away this absolute fraud.

These cameras are now in the recycling pile where they belong. I'm removing my Wyze smart lock ASAP with the expectation that they'll lock me out of my house until I subscribe to a ""smart lock basic"" plan",1
Picture Quality sucks & App is TERRIBLE!!,"Picture quality on this sucks! I have my camera on ledge of 2nd floor. I cannot make out the details of anyone’s face when they are literally walking by, less than 10ft from the camera. That goes for night or day! Then the video “skips” or blurs out parts on the images.

APP - What good is a camera if the app is crap or can’t give you what you need? This is why I hate buying cameras. These companies don’t bother to give you a preview of the app or how it works. It’s not until it’s hooked up that you find the app is worthless & cannot provide the SIMPLEST requests, requests that everyone wants. Here are my major issues with the app..,
1. CONTINUOUS recording is FAKE NEWS! It’s a unicorn.
1a. Purchased 256 GB SD card so that I COULD have continuous recordings & rewind to any time in the past week.
1b. Purchased suggested yearly Cam Plus which is supposedly needed for this.
1c. Continuous recording DOESN'T WORK! When I go through the many steps to FIND when the continuous recording would be, I find that there are NOT any recordings between “events.” I reached out to cust serv and was given this BS list of troubleshooting tasks. Tasks/steps that were listed on the start up guide for continuous recording. I replied, “All of those tasks have been performed prior to reaching out to cust serv. Here are the issues I need live assistance with…” What do I get back two days later? The EXACT same message!!! I respond again asking why someone is giving me the exact same tasks when my previous email says those tasks were performed.
1d. Another rep then responds telling me my SD card might not be in correctly. WHAT? How the hell would I have any recordings or why is the SD card showing 1/4 full?
1e. I’ve set the “zone” for capture and it still does not pick up a person or pet until they are half the distance of the zone. So I can’t see what took place from the min the person stepping into my recording zone.

USELESS CAMERA & VERY USELESS APP! ID RETURN IF THE 30 days were up.",1
" In 2025, Few Features Work Without Subscription","I used to be a huge fan of Wyze cameras. But around Jan 1, 2025, they changed their policies and are upselling their paid subscription service so heavily that the camera is virtually useless without a subscription. I used to be able to record 12-second video clips to the MicroSD card I inserted into the camera, and only do so when people or pets were motion-detected (""smart"" motion detection). Not anymore. All the camera will do now is save a single-frame screen shot when it detects motion, and it won't use smart motion detection. So now if you want to do what most people want to do (and used to be able to do before Jan 1), which is to use smart detection to record short video clips on a local MicroSD card, you can't UNLESS you purchase their monthly subscription with cloud storage. It's a classic bait and switch, because when I bought the camera a few months ago, I could use smart motion detection and local video recording without paying for a subscription...that's the whole reason I chose Wyze over their many competitors. When I contacted Wyze customer service, they a) claimed nothing has changed, b) gave me all the usual garbage answers like ""upgrade the firmware"" and ""turn it off and on"". But they refuse to acknowledge that they have completely changed access to the camera's features, to force people to pay for a monthly subscription.",1

stars Speaker came with a ""crackly"" effect on certain sounds, ZERO HELP FROM AMAZON OR SAMSUNG","ALMOST $2,000 PHONE DELIVERED W A PROBLEM, ZERO HELP FROM SAMSUNG OR AMAZON. From day 1 the ""crackly"" speaker issue has been there. I immediatley emailed amazon requesting a replacement. I was put to a clearly non english speaking chat agent, I point out the language barrier because their lack of basic english conversation makes the whole ""service"" take longer then it should and the end result is usually riddled with mistakes. He sent me a link to contact the seller and promised multiple times he'd follow up with me to make sure I got a new phone (he never followed up). I messaged the link he sent me, they got back to me and he'd sent me a link to the wrong seller. I reached out again to amazon, connected with a different clearly non english speaking agent. This new agent apologized profusely and also swore he'd help me get a new replacement ( he never followed up either). He gave me the right link to samsung, I messaged them and was routed @ to basically an email detailing where a few random electronic shops are that I could take my phone for inspection/repair.

"
Not recommended long term","At first, these headphones were phenomenal. The battery life lasted a long time, the audio was amazing, and the noise cancelling was decent. They were easy to connect and pair to multiple devices and were a fairly good pick for 30 dollars at the time. I've been a big fan of the JBL audio series.
PROS:
- Ease of Setup
- Sound Quality
- Bluetooth Connectivity
- Battery Life
- Lightweight

It does NOT work well with audio calling; you can hear it well, but the microphone does not work well, and I was told that I sound crunchy and can barely be heard. After one year of casual use (bought March 30th, 2024) and not being rough with it, it is now basically unusable. (April 4th, 2025). About every 30 seconds, it will glitch, disconnect, turn off, and then turn on again. I have attempted to factory reset it by pressing the volume up and down for five seconds, then repairing it with no use. Researching this problem, I have found this is a common bug with the 510BT. There is no way to update the firmware, as it is not compatible with the JBL headphone app.
It is highly disappointing as I was in love with these headphones other than the audio calling but they were great for music. Now with no fix, these will not work, period.

CONS:
- Calling microphone is poor quality
- Not compatible with app
- Bugged across all models
- Stopped working after one year of casual use.

Overall, for a cheap buy, it was decent at first. But I would've spent more on a better version if I knew it would break after a year due to something that isn't the user's fault. I am disappointed that these are still on the market if there is a common bug that renders the headphones useless with no fix.",1
" 6/10 sound quality, poor construction, designed to fail?","These are not the best sounding headphones. They are just a 6 out of 10, which is expected for the price. They lack critical detail and muddle a wide assortment of frequencies. If I had to guess, I'd say it has something to do with high compression coming from the audio section of the Bluetooth receiver because the sound quality resembles 128kbit or lower mp3 compression. Even the cheapest Bluetooth audio receivers are capable of higher bandwidth which can be set through firmware. It as if they needed to degrade performance to make the higher models ""better"" through settings. On top of that, the speaker diaphragms are incapable of complex music reproduction. They are heavily-dampened (too heavy, too stiff and subsequently too slow to react/accelerate; made for bass and distorted sizzle sounds but not much else), and mainly optimized for low quality, generic-mainstream-cookie-cutter-tunes-lacking-in-melody-and-full-of-rythmic-mind-programming-satanic-overtones that will not be remembered a decade from now. Basically, it impresses teenagers.

As far as comfort, yeah they grip and press on the ears if you have a large head. But it's on-ear, so it's to be expected. At least the ear pads are super soft.

Regarding build quality, maybe JBL thinks we're stupid, but right out of the box I could see red flags all over the poorly engineered swivels. They're made of a thin, frail plastic that will break-off within a matter of months of normal use. Engineers don't create flawed designs that bad unless their bosses specifically mandate it. Just adding a few pennies worth of 1mm to 2mm thicker material around the wall of the swivel would have fixed the problem. But that's probably inconceivable to the sociopathic penny-pinching corporate types at JBL.

I can't believe JBL would sink so low. They used to over-engineer everything, even their cheap stuff. It's insulting and downright disrespectful. They've adopted the same unsustainable business model practiced by a certain shortsighted country in the far east, so they can bilk their customers, make quick bank while also becoming irrelevant in the not too distant future.",1
 Amazon review,"The speaker was supposed to have a battery life of up to 7 hours. After receiving it I charged it up !00%. It ran, playing music on approximately 60% of max volume, for 3 hours and 52 minutes before shutting off because of to low battery. I thought that that was not acceptable considering the advertised 7 hours of play time so I tried to return it. Amazon offered an exchange or a cash refund of less than 60% of the purchasing price (??!). Why only <60%? Maybe because it was ""used""? But how would one find out about the too short battery life without using it? Unfortunately there no customer service chat option on the amazon website anymore (or it is so well hidden that I cannot find it) so I could not work out the issue with a customer representative. Henceforth I chose the exchange option. I repeated the procedure with the 2nd speaker I got with pretty much the same result. Run time was this time 3 hours and 57 minutes. So what are possible explanations here? Well, there could be misleading advertising on the side of JBL. Or maybe the speakers were laying around in the amazon warehouse for too long. The manual tells you to fully charge the battery at least every 3 months (or so) and that probably would not have been done during a prolonged stay in an amazon warehouse. (Note that the speaker was on sale for $10 off.) Whatever the reason, I decided to cut my loss and keep the 2nd speaker instead of going through exchange procedure again. I also decided never to buy any kind of electronics from amazon again, maybe nothing ever again period. The refund offer of less than 60% of the purchasing price combined with the disappearance of the chat option to work out complains feels insulting to me.",1
Just okay,"These earbubs are nothing special. Many years ago I bought a JBL wireless bluetooth speaker for a very reasonable price and to this day the thing still works great and sounds amazing. So that had me hopeful that these JBL earbuds would be similar.... but nope. First off, the instructions are very vague. They rely on pictures and virtually no text, so figuring out which earbud (left or right) you need to tap, and how many times you need to tap it, or if you tap and hold, etc. for the sake of raising volume, lowering volume, pausing music, etc. was really tricky. Also, I had a little bit of difficulty getting these things paired up. It wasn't anything too terrible, but none the less some more detailed instructions would be nice. As far as audio quality, it sounds pretty good strictly for voice - but leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to music. There is no bass at all and they don't get all that loud. Also, the little ""hub"" thingy that they are stored in and charged up in is poorly designed. The top of the hub doesn't open enough for an adult man's fingers to easily remove the buds from the holster. This probably wouldn't be an issue for a kid or a woman, but as an adult male my fingers are not easily able to grip the buds to remove them. It's not the end of the world, but it's annoying. So, overall I am really not impressed with these things. The only positive is that JBL normally makes a pretty reliable product, once connected the bluetooth seems to be a stable connection and the hub protects the buds really well. I bought these because for the price and JBL being a solid brand, I thought it was a good deal.... but if I had to do it over again I'd probably do a bit more research and buy something a little nicer. All of that being said, if your only need is to use these for teams meetings and conference calls at work, they'll probably be ""fine"" since the bluetooth connection seems stable and the voice audio is decent enough, but if you're looking to use these for music or in a situation where you need some more output power from the audio, I'd say avoid these things.

**UPDATE - I'm dropping this rating from 3 stars down to 1 star. These things are garbage. The mic on them just doesnt work half the time. I use these things on Microsoft Teams meetings and when the mic fails I know it's not a matter of the blue tooth dropping out because the sound is still present on the buds, so the blue tooth is clearly connected - but the mic just drops for some random reason and it happens ALL THE TIME. If you are like I was and you see that these are very reasonably priced and assume that they are probably pretty good because JBL normally makes a decent product - DO NOT make that assumption. There's a reason why some earbuds cost way more than these one and the reason is because they are way better. As I mentioned in the original review the sound from them is ""ok"" for voice only, but very weak for music. Combine that with the mic portion just flat out not working half the time and there's really not much positive here at all. I'd strongly suggest either ponying up the extra $$ and buying something nicer, or doing some research to see what the best ""value"" earbuds are at a reasonable price - because these things are not it.",1
Constant connectivity issues,"Couple month update:
The connectivity issues have gotten worse. Several times a day they disconnect and or play at different latencies. Really want to like them but sorry I just can’t get with it. Had to drop to a 1 star they’re honestly that bad at this point. They’re so inconsistent with volume and sound as well. My $10 Kurdenes sound just as good. Last just as long. And have 0 connectivity and latencies issues. But at your own risk

The sound quality is decent the app to tune them is nice. But the latency and random disconnecting basically daily at this point is getting a bit annoying. I read a review by a guy who claimed to be a music engineer. I got these to use while editing videos for my YouTube channel and there isn’t much latency but it creates a bit of a lag in the editing software only when these are connected making it hard to use for work. Then lastly, which is the most annoying because it happens constantly, if you wear a winter hat or hoody you have to make sure they aren’t even remotely close to it will constantly mess with the controls. Oh yeah I forgot to mention, occasionally the left one will lag more than the right one and it will have an echo effect. This doesn’t happen often maybe once every week or 2 but still I never had a pair of earbuds do that before. Idk maybe I got a bad pair. But for the price I expected a tad more quality especially from JBL",1
Worked properly less than 30 days,"I ordered Sept 2023, and write this in Mar 2024. I was initially very impressed by the volume and sound quality- it was what I hoped for from JBL. Compared to my previous earbuds (random-brand $15 earbuds that lasted 8 months before 1 earbud stopped working entirely) they sounded amazing. But within 30 days, the right earbud suddenly only produced 50% of its previously normal volume. Very frustrating. If I do an elaborate, tedious power-on and connection ritual, I seem to have a 10% chance of the right bud having normal volume. On top of that, within 3 months, the left earbud stopped charging properly. It doesn't make proper contact in its charge cradle. I have to keep a folded piece of paper in the case to force the left earbud down so it makes proper contact and charges (and if it's not charging, it is turned on, connecting to things and running out of battery).

So I paid close to $50 for name brand earbuds that started failing within 30 days. They started failing faster than my $15 no-brand earbuds. If the JBL earbuds last another 3-4 months, they will at least have outlived the $15 ones.

Very, very disappointed in this JBL purchase. Two thumbs down. I will hesitate to buy JBL earbuds a second time.

The good? Sound quality was impressive when they both worked properly. Battery life is still plenty long for my needs. They can stay on for many, many hours if there is little or no volume/sound being transferred through them. I have used them several time on airplanes just to block out the rumble and noise. They do a decent job of muffling noise in the environment. If they were still working normally I would give 5 stars and two thumbs up. But alas.",1
 No bass. (please read my review.),"Hi. I've worn headphones for 30 years.
Cheap. Expensive. Studio. Over. On. In.
I listen to a lot of music. I run a radio station.

These are the worst headphones I've ever experienced. Ever. For their price point, they're insulting.

Let's start with the lack of ANC.
That isn't a huge deal for me. Honestly, noise canceling makes me dizzy sometimes even good cans.

In it's stead, you'd expect for the sound quality to be so /eff you/ that who cares about ANC.

And that's where the problem starts.
The Beat 4 Solos have, perhaps, one of the most solid set of Mid drivers I've ever heard in my life.

And that's all they have.
If you like bass in any way, don't buy these headphones. They are worthless under 80hz. More like 98. And I don't say ""worthless"" as a dramatic statement. They are impotent, bereft of bass.

Two Feet, ""Go //// yourself.""
Ivy Lab, ""Orange.""
Chemical Brothers, ""My Elastic Eye.""
Lorn, ""Acid Rain.""

If you ever loved music and want to hate it? Buy these headphones. I have a huge head so I already know I messed up getting on-ears. These were on sale. So, I remembered the time we all got free Beats 1.0s and figured I buy a pair 20 years later.

They're awful.
Best mids I've ever heard.
And that's it. It's all mids.
No bass.

Literally worthless.
The only thing I've ever sent back to Amazon.

I'm literally just going to buy a pair of q45s and WH1000s' and send back whichever is worse. If you're looking at this and considering a purchase? See if the Q45s are less. I have complaints (you can read the review) about the construction but.

Friend.
These headphones suck if you're looking for any kind of bass. It's not even that they're Not Muddy. There's no water. There's no mud.

Avoid at all cost.",1
Product does not work,"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.
I ordered this product x 2. Amazon delivered the first Samsung phone to the wrong address on 7.9.24. I called to Amazon to complain and they would not issue refund and was told to wait. The picture from the Amazon delivery driver showed that it had been delivered but to the wrong unit. They said they would send another out in a couple of days. I got no email confirming this. Waited 2 days did not get replacement phone. Was lucky though because someone had dropped it off to my complex managers office and they gave me the phone. The first phone was supposed to be unlocked. Put SIM card into phone would not work. The phone was Verizon not for TMOBILE. Called to get a refund and return. Amazon sent another phone 4 days later. That phone did not work either. Would not text or turn on and off properly. So now I have to pay $40.00 toward an Uber bill to get it over to UPS or Amazon Fresh to get both returned so I can get my original $140.00 back.",1
 1) Ōura Ring Sizing Kit / 2) Ōura Ring 4 Reviews / 3) Addendum Item," Amazon, despite complaints, views the Ōura Ring Sizing Kit as the same or a similar item as the Ōura Ring 4, itself... thus, two DIFFERENT reviews AND ratings for two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT products.

--------------1) THE ŌURA RING SIZING KIT / 5-Stars

Ōura states that the Ring 4 sizes are NOT the same as traditional ring sizes.

I did NOT break out my Ring Sizing Loops to determine the veracity of that statement because the cost, of the Ring 4 Sizer, on Amazon is applied as a credit towards the cost of an Ōura Ring 4 WHEN purchased via Amazon.

I will say that there is perhaps a little difference, compared to traditional ring sizes, but I'm not sure that it's much because I ended up with the ring size that I thought would work.

Interestingly enough, size 10 that I expected for the middle finger was a perfect fit for the Index finger, which is normally a traditional 9... so there is some difference in the sizing and I wholeheartedly recommend procuring the Ōura Ring 4 Sizer BEFORE purchasing the Ōura Ring 4.

NOTE that the Ōura Ring 4 Sizer does not work for all Ōura Ring models, so anyone deciding to purchase a previous iteration of the Ōura Ring, due to cost decrease and/or a Sale, will need to utilize the correct Ōura Ring Sizer for the model ring chosen.

If there is a question of Sale or Discount Pricing, due to the delay from checking ring sizes, then I suggest an online Chat with Amazon Customer Service representative to make sure that you can lock in any discounts to use after verifying the correct Ring size.

FYI - Ōura recommends wearing the sizing ring on the finger that will bear the ring, in order to become accustomed to the ring size/feel and to see how well it fits throughout a normal day.

I followed that advice and I believe that everyone should do the same.

----------------

2) Ōura Ring 4 / 1-Star

First, even with the ring sizing kit and wearing the sizer non-stop until the Ring 4 arrived, the size of the Ring 4 in only whole sizes proved inadequate. My hands clearly fluctuate enough in size to be an issue, regardless of the finger or hand that is used.

Next, the heart rate (HR) was always available and showing in the app, signifying that the Ring 4 was measuring the HR, HOWEVER, the app called to show the graph of the HR for over two (2) weeks, meaning there was no history nor any assessment available.

Next, the Sleep function, even with learning curve, seemed to function out of the box, HOWEVER, after the first recharge of the Ring 4, there was an issue with accurately recording start and stop points of Sleep AND eventually the app would show No Sleep Data AFTER uploading/updating UNTIL THE NEXT day. There was no event showing for sleep ALTHOUGH the Ring 4 clearly annotated the Start of the Sleep period the previous night.

Next, even after more than three (3) weeks of use, the app has failed to graph the Blood Oxygen Saturation, in spite of showing the data observed and available to see at any given moment. Again, I find this to be very odd and indisputably useless to the user.

Next, the App is full of ""flash"" or substance but in terms of a quick overall view of all the numbers, like most Apps, no such uncluttered view can be found. While the plethora of information and links is appreciated, the search to locate immediate data numbers across all items is tedious, frustrating and unappreciated.

To provide an analogy, it's like having to read an entire book to search for and locate the Synopsis of the book. For those who aren't into books, then it's like watching a TV and THEN SEEING the Preview for the show that you just watched.

I and most users seem to prefer a Table of Contents approach where the Raw Data is shown and then you can click to go to the Analysis, Assessment and Suggestions for that particular Biometric.

In short, the App's interface is beautifully flashy and showy but about as useful up front as a Show Pony on a crop farm.

That makes it overwhelming, even to those who are focused readers and moreso to the vast majority who are not.

Finally, many details and assessments are NOT available for anywhere from four (4) weeks to three (3) or more months.

While understandable, it makes it impossible to fully assess the personal value and utility of the Ring 4 in the 30-day period for returns.

That means that the $400+ ring and the annual subscription fee is only acceptable for those with money to burn, so to speak, because all of the shortcomings or issues, even if expandable and temporary, outweigh the cost of what is actually a pretty doggone accurate piece of tech wear, resulting in the clear choice to return the ring.

AND... there is one other issue to consider which is that if your hands swell, perhaps from work, or shrink, perhaps from weight loss, then your $400+ ring AND subscription become useless... until you purchase another Ōura Ring that does fit.

Based on my research and experience, there are equally accurate smart fitness watches with solid Apps and reasonable insights and suggestions based on the assessment of the biometrics.

Also, there is another smart ring on the market that appears to rival the Ōura Ring in accuracy, provides an seemingly identical App for all appearances seen, comes as an adjustable ring using the same high-end materials and sensor setup AND which additionally boasts being approved and classified as a Medical Grade Device, instead of a Consumer Grade Device.

All of that at a far, far lower cost AND the same updates, assessments, insights and suggestions BUT with NO subscription fee.

That being said, I am a Go/No-Go tester of products meaning things are either 5-star or 1-star with enough details for people to decide that my 1-star item might be good enough to be their 3- or 4-star item.

The Ring 4 failed to make the grade for my needs nor was it able to justify keeping the ring to see if things improved or the money was worth the extended wait for certain observations, but it was remarkably accurate when comparing data to manual results, such as HR, SpO2, etc.

There is no blood pressure data, for those in search of BP function. I am not sure that BP could be accurately obtained below the wrist at this point in technology, but maybe in the future.

REMEMBER that when returning an Ōura Ring, you MUST also CANCEL the Ōura App Subscription as it is a separate financial issue from the purchase.

The subscription is free for the first 30-days and a part of setting up your account before you are able to use the App, so it's an easy thing to forget.

3) Addendum -- there is a charging cable organizer with a carabineer that works GREAT for the Ōura Ring 4 charging station and cable that is available on Amazon AND IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

That is my next review and it will be 5-Stars.

It was kind of a why-the-heck-not afterthought purchase that became an INSTANT 5-Star Should Have item as soon as I unpackaged it!!!!",1
Awesome,"I recently purchased the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) from Best Buy, and they are outstanding. The sound quality is phenomenal, with enhanced drivers delivering deep bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The active noise cancellation effectively blocks out background noise, and the new ear tip sizes ensure a perfect, comfortable fit. The improved battery life and quick charging feature are convenient, and pairing with my iPhone is seamless. The intuitive touch controls and the new Find My feature add to their appeal. Overall, these AirPods offer exceptional sound, comfort, and advanced features.",4
Amazing but falls out of ear.,"Sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life are stellar! The fit of the airpods, regardless of the changeable size  attachments leaves much to be desired because they consistently fall out of the ear.",4
Good product but BestBuy support sucks,"I called up “BestBuy” and this guy lied trying to sct like he was the store, he was corporate bestbuy. I asked him aboit a specific location and basically he said that this location only had 1 airpod pro 2nd gen left so he went through the process to “rewerve” it come to find out in store he legit just did a in-store pickup order and i could not pick it up because of the wait timr. He told me i could pick it up though. Basically that BestBuy location had plenty of Airpod Pro 2nd gen and that was a lie. Other than that the product it self currently is a good deal, nice noise cancelation, i love the airpods.",4

Great set of headphones, but could use more tips","So far, I’ve been really impressed with these headphones, especially the little features. They pair super easily with my iPhone and MacBook, and the stem has a lot more features than my old AirPods 2 (regular) had. They have the ability to go between ANC and pass through mode, and change the volume. It’s been great! I’ve also loved the wireless charging AND the built in speaker to help me find the headphones using find my. Great idea!

My only two grips with these headphones are that I had to exchange the original pair due to the right headphone not charging. Kinda annoying, but not the end of the world. I did buy a separate AppleCare+ plan though, in case this happens again in the future. Second, the eartips are not all that comfortable. Though, my ears are an unusual shape, and basically no in-ear headphones are comfortable. I also like that there are a swath of 3rd party available. Im going to try some foam tips and see if that helps comfort/fit. 

Overall, I’ve been really happy with these headphones so far, and I recommend them to anyone with multiple Apple devices, as the device switching is the killer feature for AirPods.",4
Powerful Performance with a Premium Price,"I recently upgraded to the MacBook Pro 14-inch with the M3 chip, and I’m really impressed with its performance. The M3 chip is lightning-fast, making multitasking, video editing, and even gaming smoother than ever. The screen is gorgeous, with vibrant colors and sharp details, perfect for watching movies or editing photos. Battery life is solid, easily lasting me through a full workday.

The only downsides I’ve noticed are the high price and the limited ports—you're going to need adapters for some devices. Overall, it's a great laptop for power users, but the cost and lack of ports might not be ideal for everyone. Highly recommend if you need top-tier performance!

Most Reliable PC,"The MacBook Pro is a powerhouse for professionals, combining stunning performance with a sleek design. Its M-series chip delivers incredible speed, seamless multitasking, and long battery life. The Retina display is vibrant, and the build quality is premium, making it ideal for creative work like photo editing and video production. However, the premium price point may deter budget-conscious buyers. Limited port options (especially on newer models) can be inconvenient, requiring adapters for many peripherals. Additionally, macOS is excellent for Apple ecosystem users but may pose a learning curve for others. Overall, it’s a top-tier laptop with minor trade-offs.",4
"Amazing laptop, only downside is the price.","This is my first Mac laptop. My boss has sworn by macs for many years and most of the team poked lighthearted jokes about him being the only one who uses a mac. After many months of watching him work the speed at which he got tasks done was amazing to me and he credited it largely to his laptop being a Mac. My old windows laptop broke and I needed something powerful that I could travel with while still getting my programming done so I decided to take a leap of faith and see what all the fuss was about. I have enjoyed using a MacBook very much over the last few months, I have even cut down the amount of time using my desktop because I typically just grab my laptop when I need to get something done. The build is amazing, OS is sleek, speed and battery life are insane. I have used tons of windows laptops and I have been used to any sort power usage resulting in 2 hours of battery life before needing a charge, using this has spoiled me, I get over double what I used to on my windows laptop in between charges. The only downside that has serious weight in my mind was the price. I personally feel happy with my purchase, and would recommend to anyone who is doing some power hungry work on the go.",4
"Overall, pretty great","Terrific laptop with terrific build quality. Feels substantial, but not too heavy. The perfect level of thickness without being too thick, or too thin. Also, visually very attractive. Runs quick and can handle a great deal. However, and after 15 years of the same, this is par the course - as far as the hardware itself goes, you get comparatively little if you were to invest the same amount of cash into a windows laptop. 

One thing that is somewhat concerning is the magnetic charger - there's nothing wrong with it, it's fine, but it *feels* like apple is trying to move away from the usb-c standard that the whole industry (including apple) had finally adopted across the board. Like, just, come on. Don't do this, apple. Don't push another niche cable.",4
Happy with purchase,"Christmas gift for my son who doesnt have a TV in his room and since he has a gaming set up there really isnt room for one, so i got this. I didn't buy a screen, so i was happy to see how clear it shows on the wall. 

I do need to buy a firestick, I thought this device allowed streaming apps to be downloaded but that was my mistake. The image is crystal clear in the dark which is a plus, but its also pretty clear in the day time (see image 1). If you cannot see image well during the day im sure you can change the settings to make the image better. Other photo taken at night, like i said very clear image. 

I am using screen mirroring from my iphone currently until the firestick comes. I do notice a lag sometimes when screen mirroring. As far as not being able to screen mirror using Hulu or Netflix, please be advised that it is those apps that do not allow this! Its not the projector. Even if you try using screen mirroring with the Hulu app on your flat screen TV it will not allow it. 

In conclusion, son is happy with purchase and excited to have something he can watch in his room.",4

Good picture, low volume","Setup was pretty straightforward, and the picture quality was surprisingly good.  We've only used this once, to view a Pixar movie displayed on a bedsheet suspended on a makeshift frame we set up on the deck near our pool.  We had to view it after dark to actually see the image, and considering our impromptu screen, the picture was decent.  Our only complaint would be the audio volume; we had to be really quiet to hear the dialogue.  I learned later that I could connect to an external speaker via Bluetooth, but I've not yet checked that out.",4
"
Decent projector for the price","I was very skeptical about this given its $170. Picture quality was actually pretty dang good. Brightness at first was lacking, but better when i replaced the $400 screen with a $20 silver satin sheet. I don't use the Wi-Fi very often, but unlike others, i never had any issues. I mainly use my Strm Box and it's never had any issues. I also have never used the internal speakers. Aleady have a speaker setup and would not compare the quality of the speakers of a projector. It's not like it comes with dolby atmos built in. Is basic stereo speakers. But all in all, it's not a bad projector for the price",4
Decent projector for the price.,"Decent projector in a room without too much sunlight and with a screen. I tried it without a screen and in the sunlight and it was pretty hard to see the image. With the lights lowered and using a screen, the picture was much clearer. The ability to stream directly to it from your phone is awesome but I never got it to work. I would mirror my phone and it would start showing my phone on the screen, but once I started playing something it would just play on my phone and not the projector. I also could not play from my phone and Bluetooth the audio at the same time, so the audio was pretty bad. But... it's only 180$. It does the job for 180$",4
Ok TV,"Bought the TV because of the great deal. Wanted a bigger TV in the basement ""she cave"". Wasn't worried about the picture quality so much, because I was going to use the 4k firestick. The TV definitely does not like you using a different device (remote) but it works. The TV remote is trash, but already knew that from reading other reviews. For the price it was definitely worth it, full price I would have picked a different TV.",4
Good for the price and great size,"I’ve had the LG 65-inch UT70 Series for a while now, and overall, it’s a solid TV for the price. The picture quality is sharp, with vibrant colors and good contrast, making movies and shows look great. Setting it up was easy, and the design is sleek with thin bezels, which gives it a modern look. The built-in webOS has all the major streaming apps, but the system can be a little slow at times, especially when navigating menus or switching between apps. The sound is decent for a TV, but I’d recommend a soundbar if you want a fuller audio experience. One downside is the remote—it’s small and not the easiest to use, especially in the dark. Also, while the TV handles regular HD and 4K content well, it doesn’t get very bright for HDR, so it’s not the best for super detailed highlights in darker scenes. But for the price, it’s a great value, especially if you just want a big screen with good quality for everyday watching. If you’re not too picky about high-end features, it’s definitely worth considering.",4
It works but i regret my purchase,"For the most part it's working for me. I just have a few gripes... 1) You know how most remotes have that ok button surrounded by 4 arrows? I like to able to feel that in the dark. This remote has these buttons very similar to the ones around it. You'll accidentally press the wrong one. 
2) the processor feels so slow. It takes awhile to load between functions or change LG internal channels.
3) Like most devices now a days, it forces you to agree to terms of service in order to use it. I just know that data farming is a thing.",4
"
Good Purchase","Purchased this to replace my second failed Vizio.  I purchased a Samsung prior to buying this LG, the remote control system was designed by an idiot, so I took it back.  This TV performs great, the only thing I dislike is the volume control.  It has an automatic system, which I think is suppose to receive different input audio signals and maintain a preset volume, it won't do that.  If I am watching antenna TV or WiFi TV the volume is fairly consistent.  If I go to my Tablo or Roku input the volume has to be increased a lot.",4
Pretty cool iPhone gaming accessory,"I was never really a huge iPhone gamer to begin with. I mean, most of the games are geared for ""basic"" play and it was all touch screen so, why bother? 

It wasn't until they started releasing older, console games in iOS did I start to take gaming on my iPhone a little more seriously. Specifically, the COD and GTA franchises were big in my book so really cool to have these titles added to the mobile gaming platforms. 

BUT, biggest drawback for me was the touch screen interface. Not really conducive to gaming on that level since the movements and actions a lot more involved in those types of games. That said, pairing this SCUD controller to my iPhone has really made a world of difference in terms of playability. 

It connects via bluetooth and has a companion app where you can sync and remap buttons as you see fit. So much nicer using this setup to play GTA Vice City than some on-screen keypad or separate controller. The grip fits and feels really nice and isn't too bulky. It's noticeable but not annoying by any means. 

This will fit just about any phone/case out there....just about. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit my setup at the moment. I have an iPhone 14 Pro Max with an Otterbox Defender XT case and it's, literally, like 2mm too long for the controller. I have to take my phone out of the case in order to use this controller. Sort of a pain but it's doable. If I had a slimmer case then it probably would've fit without issue.",4
Could be better,"The overall fell of the controller is a lot better for people who are used to playing on an xbox/ PS controller, i would definitely recommend this to someone with larger hands. The only con it has is its bluetooth connectivity, while it isnt always a problem the controller’s input might lag on more demanding games sometimes. It isnt always a problem but when it begins to happen you will definitely notice it.",4
"
Good but not for me","The joysticks felt nice, minimal input lag through Bluetooth and felt nice in the hands. Fit my iPhone 16 pro max with a slightly hefty case on no problem. Controller felt decent enough in my hands but the face buttons were small and felt mushy to press for me. 

Returned them.",4
A useful iPhone / iPad only controller,"Like every Scuf controller I've tried, the Nomad has a good feel to it. Nice heft, feels solid in your hands. The thumbsticks are smooth. The face buttons could be a little crisper, but they're not bad. The bottom triggers have a fairly short throw; this isn't helpful for driving games where more fine control on throttle and brakes matter.

The Nomad has the same problem most mobile controllers have due to its small size. The d-pad and face buttons are directly below the thumbsticks rather than being diagonally offset. Using the thumbsticks and triggers is fine, but you really need to curl your thumbs in to use the face buttons and d-pad, and it's not comfortable. The alternative is to shift your grip so you're holding the controller higher up in your hands, mostly with your fingers. But with the weight of a phone in the controller, it makes it quite top-heavy and is not easy to hold in this manner.

Other than that, it's a fine controller. Whether its worth the $100 to you depends on how much gaming on your phone or tablet matters to you. Though it doesn't say explicitly, this controller is also compatible with an iPad, which is where I mostly use it. Rather than taking it on the go with my phone, I use an iPad as a second screen for Xbox and PlayStation and use this controller for playing remote when the TV is otherwise occupied. Or if you want to play for a few minutes in bed before going to sleep.

Biggest limitation is that it only works with iPhone and iPad. It would be really nice if you could also use it with Android or just as a generic Bluetooth controller with computers as well, but it is what it is.",4
